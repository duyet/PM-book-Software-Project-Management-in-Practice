<h3><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Arial'>8.1 TEAM
MANAGEMENT</span></h3>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Software development is a team effort. High
quality and productivity result when the team members contribute effectively
and remain motivated, and the overall team functions smoothly and efficiently. Team
management goes beyond engineering and project management issues into the
domain of people issues. It is an important aspect of the project, and ignoring
it can spell trouble for the project and the project manager.</span></p>

<h4><a name=ch08lev2sec1></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>8.1.1 Team Structure</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>At Infosys, a hierarchical team structure is
usually employed; a team is headed by a project manager, who reports to the
business manager or the account manager (or both). In addition, a typical team
consists of developers (DVs), the configuration controller (CC), and the
database administrator; all these members report to the project manager. A
large project may also have module leaders, each of whom reports to the project
manager and has some developers under him. Also, a defect prevention team is
formed from the existing team members; this team is responsible for performing
the tasks related to defect prevention.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>As discussed earlier, an SEPG member known as
the software quality adviser (SQA) is also associated with each project. The
SQA interacts extensively with the project manager (and with the configuration
controller) but does not report to the project manager. Instead, the SQA has an
independent reporting channel.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The assignment of roles is a complex task. The
project manager's objective is to get a balanced, self-reliant team that helps
to further the careers and skill development of the team members. Hence, in
determining the team structure, the project manager must factor in the personal
and growth needs of the team members as well as the project needs. Following
are some of the people factors that a project manager takes into account:</span></p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

members</span></p>

lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Personal aspirations and career paths of the
members</span></p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Mentoring and people development needs</p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The initial team structure is documented in
the PMP along with the roles and responsibilities of each team member. A team
member may have multiple responsibilities. During the course of the project,
particularly a long project, the team organization may be changed based on the
performance of people in the different roles, personal aspirations, motivation
levels, and so on.</span></p>

<h4><a name=ch08lev2sec2></a><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:Arial'>8.1.2
Communication</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>A team that will work together for a few
months toward a common goal must jell well and must have good intrateam
communication. The team communication can be broadly divided into two
categories: communication relating to the project and de-stressing
communication. A good people-oriented project manager plans for both.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>One way to keep the team members informed
about the progress and problems in the project is to give them access to the
project status reports and associated customer and business manager comments. In
addition to these formal reports, depending on the size of the team and the
project duration, Infosys project managers use any of the following methods to
enhance team communication:</span></p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Project-specific bulletin boards for
announcements, notices, status reports, and so on</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Moreover, because deadlines are usually short
and everyone is under time pressure, stress tends to build up. Communication
aimed at de-stressing is extremely important to ensure continued motivation. Many
project managers plan events that enable this &quot;fun&quot; communication. </span>Here
are examples of the methods used:</p>

Team Development</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Project teams often include many junior
people. It is the responsibility of the team and the project manager to enhance
the personal development of these team members. Helping the growth of
individual team members also benefits the project and the organization. As the
skills and abilities of the team members improve, they become more productive
later in the project and can take on more responsibility. And, of course, they
become better equipped to handle their tasks in future projects. Toward this
end, project managers use methods such as these:</span></p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
