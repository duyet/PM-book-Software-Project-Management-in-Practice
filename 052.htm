<h3><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Arial'>8.2 CUSTOMER
COMMUNICATION AND ISSUE RESOLUTION</span></h3>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Team communication is geared toward keeping
the team informed and motivated. But what about the customer, who is the
sponsor of the project and hence a major stakeholder? Many problems are the
result of misunderstandings between the customer and the developers. Regular
communication between the development team and the customer can help avoid
these kinds of problems.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Status reports (discussed in </span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch11#ch11"><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>Chapter 11</span></a><span lang=EN-GB>), one
such means of communication, are designed to give the customer a clear idea of
the state of the project on an ongoing basis. However, these reports, no matter
how elaborate, are not enough. Project managers should plan other means of
communication, including weekly teleconferencing or videoconferencing and
regular e-mails. In a weekly virtual meeting, the project leader walks through
the status report with the customer and explains the project constraints. A key
point of discussion is resolution of pending issues. The customer, on the other
hand, seeks clarifications and explains her perspective in these meetings. Overall,
through regular communication that goes beyond sending reports, both the
customer and the development team remain in sync. This prevents many potential
problems rooted in misunderstandings.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Despite the use of regular communication
channels, issues crop up that the representatives at the two ends cannot
resolve. Such issues can potentially delay the project and must be escalated. To
facilitate resolution of such issues, a project plan specifies the escalation
channels at both the customer end and at the Infosys end. The plan also clearly
states the policies regarding when these channels are to be deployed. In
addition to providing a mechanism for issue resolution, the specification of
this escalation channel and policies creates pressure on the two parties to
resolve issues quickly and when necessary to take them to the higher-ups.</span></p>
