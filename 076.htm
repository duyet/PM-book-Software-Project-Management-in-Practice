<h3><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Arial'>11.6 SUMMARY</span></h3>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>When a plan is executed, regardless of how
carefully the planning was done, things frequently do not work out as planned. With
proper monitoring, a project manager can check whether or not the project is progressing
as planned. If it is not progressing along the desired path, control must be
applied to ensure that the project still meets its objectives.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>At Infosys, project monitoring occurs at
several different levels. </span>Following are the lessons from this approach:</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Track the completion of scheduled activities,
the defects found, and the issues that come up. Use a weekly status report for
regular tracking and reporting.</span></p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>At project milestones, compare the actual values
for schedule, effort, and defects with the estimated values. If the deviation
exceeds the predetermined threshold, take corrective and preventive actions if
the situation warrants. </span>Also, revisit the risks and situations that
affect risks.</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Evaluate some tasks immediately after they have
been executed and take corrective actions if the performance is not within the
expected range, as determined from past data. Reviews and unit testing are best
suited for this level of tracking.</span></p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Analyze the defect data from the first few modules
in the project to understand the root causes of the defects. Then take actions
to eliminate the root causes. Later, repeat this analysis to understand the
impact of defect prevention.</span></p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Audit the project formally for compliance with
the defined processes. Based on the noncompliance reports, take corrective and
preventive actions.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>From the CMM perspective, the techniques
discussed in this chapter satisfy some of the requirements of the Project
Tracking and Oversight KPA at level 2, the Integrated Project Management KPA at
level 3, and the Quantitative Process Management KPA at level 4. The process
monitoring and audit activities satisfy some requirements of the Software
Quality Assurance KPA at level 2 and the audit requirements of some other KPAs.
The defect analysis and prevention activities satisfy some of the requirements
of the Defect Prevention KPA at level 5.</span></p>
