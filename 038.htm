<h3><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Arial'>6.2 RISK
ASSESSMENT</span></h3>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>In a project at Infosys, risk assessment
consists of the two traditional components: risk identification and risk
prioritization. The risk identification activity focuses on enumerating
possible risks to the project. The basic activity is to try to envision all
situations that might make things in the project go wrong. The risk
prioritization activity considers all aspects of all risks and then prioritizes
them (for the purposes of risk management). Although the two are distinct
activities, they are often carried out simultaneously. That is, a project
manager may identify and analyze the risks together.</span></p>

<h4><a name=ch06lev2sec1></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>6.2.1 Risk Identification</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>For a project, any condition, situation, or
event that can occur and would jeopardize the success of the project
constitutes a risk. Identifying risks is therefore an exercise in envisioning
what can go wrong. Methods that can aid risk identification include checklists
of possible risks, surveys, meetings and brainstorming, and reviews of plans, processes,
and work products.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch06lev1sec6#ch06entry05"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>5</span></sup></a><span lang=EN-GB> Checklists
of frequently occurring risks are probably the most common tool for risk
identification. SEI has also provided a taxonomy of risks to aid in risk
identification.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch06lev1sec6#ch06entry07"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>7</span></sup></a></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>At Infosys, the commonly occurring risks for
projects have been compiled from a survey of previous projects. This list forms
the starting point for identifying risks for the current project. Frequently,
the risks in the current project will appear on the list.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>A project manager can also use the process
database to get information about risks and risk management on similar projects.
Evaluating and thinking about previously encountered risks also help identify
other risks that may be pertinent to this project but do not appear on the
list.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Project managers can also use their judgment
and experience to evaluate the situation to identify potential risks. Another
alternative is to use the project management plan review and discussion
meetings to elicit views on risks from others.</span></p>

<h4><a name=ch06lev2sec2></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>6.2.2 Risk Prioritization</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The identified risks for a project merely
give the possible events that can hinder it from meeting its goals. The
consequences of various risks, however, may differ. Before you proceed with
managing risks, you must prioritize them so that management energies can be
focused on the highest risks.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Prioritization requires analyzing the
possible effects of the risk event in case it actually occurs. That is, if the
risk materializes, what will be the loss to the project? The loss could include
a direct loss, a loss due to lost business opportunity or future business, a
loss due to diminished employee morale, and so on. Based on the possible
consequences and the probability of the risk event occurring, you can compute
the risk exposure, which you can then use for prioritizing risks.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>This approach requires a quantitative
assessment of the risk probability and the risk consequences. Usually, little
historical data are available to help you make a quantitative estimate of these
parameters. Because risks are probabilistic events, they occur infrequently,
and that makes it difficult to gather data about them. Furthermore, any such
data must be interpreted properly because the act of managing the risks affects
them. This fact implies that risk prioritization will be based more on
experience than on hard data from the past. In this situation, categorizing
both the probabilities and the consequences can serve to separate high-priority
risk items from lower-priority items.</span><a

</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Select the top few risk items for mitigation and
tracking.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The main objective of risk management is to
identify the top few risk items and then focus on them. For this purpose, using
classification works well. Clearly, a risk that has a high probability of
occurring and that has high consequences is a risk with high risk exposure and
therefore one with a high priority for risk management.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>When you work with classifications, a problem
in prioritization can arise if the risk probability and risk effects ratings
are either (high, medium) or (medium, high). In this case, it is not clear
which risk should be ranked higher. An easy approach to handle this situation
is to mitigate both the risks. If needed, you can differentiate between these
types of risks by using actual numbers.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>This approach for prioritizing risks helps
focus attention on high risks, but it does not help you in making a
cost-benefit analysis of risk mitigation options. That is, by stating the
consequences in terms of a scale rather than in terms of money value, this
method does not allow you to calculate the expected loss in financial terms. Hence,
you cannot analyze whether a certain risk mitigation strategy, costing a
certain amount, is worth employing. Such an analysis is generally not needed,
however, because the focus of risk management is usually on managing risks at
the lowest cost and not on whether risk management itself is beneficial. On the
other hand, if you must make a decision about whether a risk should be managed
or whether it is financially smarter to leave it unmanaged, you must understand
the financial impact of the risk.</span></p>
