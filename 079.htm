<h3><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Arial'>12.1 PROJECT
CLOSURE ANALYSIS</span></h3>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Project closure analysis is the key to
learning from the past so as to provide future improvements. To achieve this
goal, it must be done carefully in an atmosphere of safety so that lessons can
be captured and used to improve the process and future projects. Before we
describe the details of the closure analysis report, we briefly discuss the
role of closure analysis and its implementation.</span></p>

<h4><a name=ch12lev2sec1></a><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:Arial'>12.1.1
The Role of Closure Analysis</span></h4>

<p class=doctext>The objective of a postmortem or closure analysis is &quot;to
determine what went right, what went wrong, what worked, what did not, and how
it could be made better the next time.&quot;<a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch12lev1sec4#ch12entry02"><sup><span
style='color:#003399'>2</span></sup></a> Relevant information must be collected
from the project, primarily for use by future projects. That is, the purpose of
having an identified completion analysis activity, rather than simply saying,
&quot;The project is done,&quot; is not to help this project but rather to
improve the organization by leveraging the lessons learned. This type of
learning can be supported effectively by analysis of data from completed
projects. This analysis is also needed to understand the performance of the
process on this project, which in turn is needed to determine the process
capability.</p>

<p class=doctext>As noted earlier, the data obtained during the closure
analysis are used to populate the process database (PDB). The data from the PDB
can be used directly by subsequent projects for planning purposes. This
information is also used in computing the process capability, which is used by
projects in planning and for analyzing trends. <a

<p class=doctext align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0

<p class=doctext>Earlier chapters discuss the types of data generally collected
in a project and describe the collection methods. The amount of raw data
collected in a project can be quite large. For example, a project involving
five people and lasting for 25 weeks will have 125 entries for weekly effort,
data for about 250 defects (assuming about 0.05 defects injected per
person-hour), data on many change requests, various outputs, and so on.
Clearly, these data will be of limited use unless they are analyzed and
presented within a proper framework and at a suitable level of abstraction.
Closure analysis aims to accomplish this goal.</p>

<p class=doctext>After data analysis and extraction of all lessons learned from
the analyses, the results should be packaged so that they can be used by others
(packaging is the last step in the quality improvement paradigm<a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch12lev1sec4#ch12entry06"><sup><span
style='color:#003399'>6</span></sup></a>). Furthermore, to leverage this
information, project processes must be constructed so that their execution
requires the effective use of data. It can be argued, however, that even if
others do not learn from the packaged information, the project personnel will
have consolidated their experience and will carry the lessons learned from the
analysis into future projects.<a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch12lev1sec4#ch12entry02"><sup><span
style='color:#003399'>2</span></sup></a> In other words, a closure analysis is
useful even if others do not directly gain from it.</p>

<h4><a name=ch12lev2sec2></a><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:Arial'>12.1.2
Performing Closure Analysis</span></h4>

<p class=doctext>At Infosys, the project manager carries out the closure
analysis with help from the SEPG quality adviser associated with the project. A
template for the analysis report has been defined. The person carrying out the
closure analysis must fill out this template properly, using mostly the metrics
data, thereby keeping the focus on objective information.</p>

<p class=doctext>As discussed earlier, the effort data are available from the
weekly activity report database. The defect data can be gathered from the
defect control system. Size data are obtained from the project. Planning data
appear in the project management plan. These data constitute the main
information needed for metrics analysis.</p>

<p class=doctext>The data are first analyzed by the quality adviser, who
develops an initial interpretation of the results. A meeting is then held among
the quality adviser, the project leader, and other project members. The initial
report serves as the basis of discussion, and further points and observations
from the meeting are also noted. This meeting yields the basis of the final
closure analysis report.</p>

<p class=doctext>The final report is submitted to the SEPG and the business
manager of the project and is shared among the project team members. The report
is also entered in the PDB, making it available for future projects and
analyses.</p>

<h4><a name=ch12lev2sec3></a><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:Arial'>12.1.3
Closure Analysis Report</span></h4>

<p class=doctext>This section briefly discusses the major elements in an
Infosys project closure analysis report; later, we present the closure report
of the ACIC project. The contents of this analysis report form a superset of
the data that are put in the PDB. The PDB contains only those metrics data that
are needed often by projects and whose use is required by the current
processes. The analysis report, however, may capture other data that might shed
light on process performance or help to better explain the process.</p>

<h5><a name=ch12lev3sec1></a><span style='font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial'>General
and Process-Related Information</span></h5>

<p class=doctext>The closure report first gives general information about the
project, the overall productivity achieved and quality delivered, the process
used and process deviations, the estimated and actual start and end dates, the
tools used, and so on. This section might also include a brief description of
the project's experience with tools (detailed &quot;experience reports&quot;
are put into the BOK system). The information about tools can be used by other
projects to decide whether use of the tool is warranted. It can also be
examined to identify tools that have good advantages and to propagate their use
throughout the rest of the organization.</p>

<h5><a name=ch12lev3sec2></a><span style='font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Risk
Management</span></h5>

<p class=doctext>The risk management section gives the risks initially
anticipated for the project along with the risk mitigation steps planned. In
addition, this section lists the top risks as viewed in the post-project
analysis (they are the real risks for the project). This information can be
used by later projects and can be used to update risk management guidelines.
Notes may also be provided on the effectiveness of the mitigation steps
employed.</p>

<h5><a name=ch12lev3sec3></a><span style='font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Size</span></h5>

<p class=doctext>As discussed in <a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch06#ch06"><span
style='color:#003399'>Chapter 6</span></a>, many projects use the bottom-up
method for estimation. In this method, the size of the software is estimated in
terms of the number of simple, medium, or complex modules. Hence, this size is
captured along with the criteria used for classification (different projects
may use different criteria). Data on both the estimated size and the actual
size are included.</p>

<p class=doctext>For normalization purposes, the productivity of a project is
measured in terms of function points (FP) per person-month. Although FP can be
counted by studying the functionality of the system, at closure time it is
computed from the measured size in lines of code (LOC). If multiple languages
are used, we simply add the sizes (in FP) of the modules in different
languages. Strictly speaking, function points (unlike lines of code) are not an
additive measure. Because we are measuring only the size of the complete system
in FP, however, this approach is equivalent to converting all LOC counts into
an LOC count of some &quot;universal&quot; language and then converting that
size into FP. Furthermore, because of the inherent limitations of software
metrics and their use, some inaccuracies are acceptable, provided that the
methods are used consistently. The size in FP is also captured in the closure
analysis report.</p>

<h5><a name=ch12lev3sec4></a><span style='font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Effort</span></h5>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The closure analysis report also contains the
total estimated effort and the actual effort in person-hours. The total
estimated effort is obtained from the project management plan. The total actual
effort is the sum of the total effort reported in all WARs submitted by the
project members, including the project leader. If the deviation between the
actual and the estimated values is large, reasons for this variation are
recorded.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>For each of the major steps in the process,
the total actual effort and estimated effort for the stage are captured, too. This
information can be useful in planning, and it is a key input in forming the
PCB. For each stage, where possible, the effort is separated into the effort
for the task, for the review, and for the rework. The WAR codes described
earlier in the book permit this separation. The distribution of effort in the
various phases can then be computed and recorded. The separation of effort
between task, review, and rework aids in identifying the scope of productivity
improvement.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The cost of quality for the project is also
computed. It measures the cost of all activities that directly contributed to
achieving quality. The cost of quality can be defined in many ways; here it is
defined as the percentage of the total effort spent in review, testing, rework
to remove defects, and project-specific training.</span></p>

<h5><a name=ch12lev3sec5></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.5pt;
font-family:Arial'>Defects</span></h5>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The defects section of the closure analysis
report contains a summary of the defects found during the project. The defects
can be analyzed with respect to severity (percentage of defects that were
major, minor, or cosmetic), stage detected (percentage of total detected
defects detected by which activity), stage injected (which activity introduced
what percentage of total defects), and so on. Injection rate and defect
distribution are also determined.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The defect removal efficiency of a defect
removal task is defined as the percentage of total defects that existed at the
time of execution of the task that are detected by the execution of the task. This
metric is useful for determining which quality activities need improvement. The
closure report gives the defect removal efficiency of the major quality control
tasks, as well as the overall defect removal efficiency of the process. Other
analyses of defect data may also be included. Sometimes, a separate analysis of
the review data may be performed. The estimated versus actual defect levels are
also analyzed.</span></p>

<h5><a name=ch12lev3sec6></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.5pt;
font-family:Arial'>Causal Analysis</span></h5>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>When the project is finished, the performance
of the overall process on this project is known. If the performance is outside
the range given in the capability baseline, there is a good chance that the
variability has an assignable cause. Causal analysis involves looking at large
variations and then identifying their causes, generally through discussion and
brainstorming.</span></p>

<h5><a name=ch12lev3sec7></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.5pt;
font-family:Arial'>Process Assets</span></h5>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>In addition to the metrics data, other
project artifacts are potentially useful for future projects. </span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch02#ch02"><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>Chapter 2</span></a><span lang=EN-GB>
discusses the use of process assets. These process assets are collected at
project closure. The potential entries to the BOK are also identified during
closure, although they are submitted later.</span></p>
