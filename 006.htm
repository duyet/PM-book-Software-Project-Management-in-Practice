<h3><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Arial'>1.3 PROJECT
MANAGEMENT AT INFOSYS</span></h3>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Infosys executes hundreds of projects each
year. Full responsibility for executing a project rests with the project
manager, who must make sure that the project team delivers high-quality
software to the customer on time and within cost. To help the project manager
fulfill this responsibility, support from the organization is necessary. This
section provides a brief background on Infosys and its support for managing
projects.</span></p>

<h4><a name=ch01lev2sec3></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>1.3.1 Background: Infosys</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Infosys is a software house headquartered in
Bangalore, India. Its stated mission is &quot;to be a globally respected
corporation that provides best-of-breed software solutions delivered by
best-in-class people.&quot; It employs the global delivery model, in which the
customer can be located anywhere in the world and customer fulfillment can be
provided from anywhere. In this model, the customer is sought anywhere in the
world where it provides the most value to the company. For customer
fulfillment, a combination of processes, technology, and management is employed
to segregate the work so that value can be added in the most optimum locations
and then reaggregated for delivery to the customer.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Infosys currently employs about 10,000
people, with about 15 development centers in four countries and offices in more
than a dozen countries. The company was founded in 1981 by seven software
professionals with an equity base of only $300. Today, Infosys has a market
capitalization of more than $8 billion (based on market rates in June 2001),
and its revenue was more than $400 million in 2000 (revenue in 1994 was $9.5
million). Its customers are spread across the globe and include major
corporations—more than 60 of them being Fortune 1000 companies—that are engaged
in diverse businesses such as banking, retailing, manufacturing,
telecommunications, financial services, insurance, and transportation.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Infosys is a highly respected company that
has been rated as the best managed and most respected company in India and one
of Asia's leading information technology (IT) companies. It has bagged many
awards, including the Ramakrishna Bajaj award, which is modeled after the
Malcolm Balridge award. It can be safely said that Infosys is one of the best
software services corporations in the world.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Infosys provides a top-notch infrastructure
so that its project managers can better serve the needs of its worldwide
customers. The company has provided audio conferencing facilities to almost
every group so that project managers can interact easily with customers and
with group members located in different sites. Similarly, a state-of-the-art
video conferencing facility is used for interaction among the company's various
locations as well as for virtual meetings. Its main campus in Bangalore is now
one of the largest software service facilities in the world, with work-related
facilities such as a library, extensive computing and networking facilities,
training facilities, discussion rooms, projection facilities, and so on, as
well as recreational facilities such as an art gallery, a health club, and
facilities for tennis, basketball, and so on.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Process orientation and improvement are a
part of the Infosys work culture, and processes are defined for most tasks that
are performed regularly. For process definition and improvement, Infosys first
adopted the ISO 9000 framework and got its ISO certification in 1993. To
further improve the software process, Infosys then adopted the CMM framework. It
was first assessed at level 4 in December 1997, and then at level 5 in December
1999. In its pursuit of continuous improvement, Infosys now employs the Malcolm
Balridge framework for all-around improvement and building leadership
excellence in all areas of operation.</span></p>

<h4><a name=ch01lev2sec4></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>1.3.2 SEPG Support to Projects</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The quality department at Infosys contains
the software engineering process group (SEPG). The SEPG is responsible for
coordinating all the process activities, including process definition, process
improvement, and process deployment. It also manages all information and data
related to the use of processes (such as the process database and the process
capability baseline, which are discussed further in </span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch02#ch02"><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>Chapter 2</span></a><span lang=EN-GB>).</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Although the responsibility for all aspects
of delivery, including quality, belongs to the project team, the SEPG
facilitates the project team in following the right processes. The SEPG also
forms an independent channel for monitoring and reporting to senior management
on process and quality issues. Because &quot;processes won't stick by
themselves,&quot;</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch01lev1sec6#ch01entry06"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>6</span></sup></a><span lang=EN-GB> the SEPG
helps to ensure that the defined processes are implemented and become standard
practice.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>To this end, in addition to offering training
on processes, the SEPG provides a member who is associated with a project as a <span
class=docemphasis1>software quality adviser</span>. The quality adviser assists
in defining and following processes, ensures that the processes are followed,
aids in analyzing the data, and provides any needed process training. Because
the adviser is well versed on processes, guidelines, and so on, the adviser's
main help comes during project planning. The adviser also reviews the project
plan to ensure that it contains all the key elements.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>In addition to providing consulting and help
with processes and metrics, the Infosys SEPG schedules and manages regular
independent audits (see </span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch11#ch11"><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>Chapter 11</span></a><span lang=EN-GB>) to
ensure that the defined processes and standards are being followed.</span></p>

<h4><a name=ch01lev2sec5></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>1.3.3 Senior Management Involvement in Projects</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Infosys prides itself in providing value to
its customers through delivery excellence. Everything at Infosys, including its
organizational structure, is driven by the aim of serving customers efficiently
and effectively and quickly tapping new business opportunities.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>For delivery of customer services, Infosys
has many <span class=docemphasis1>business units</span>. </span>Within a
business unit, a <span class=docemphasis1>team,</span> headed by a <span
class=docemphasis1>project manager</span>, executes a project. The project
manager is responsible for all aspects of project execution, from determining
the requirements to final installation of the software. The project manager
reports to a <span class=docemphasis1>business manager</span>, who in turn
generally reports to the <span class=docemphasis1>business unit head</span>.</p>

<p class=doctext>To handle situations that cannot be resolved by the project
manager, senior management involvement in projects is essential. At Infosys,
the business manager regularly interacts with the project manager and monitors
the project through status reports and milestone reports (discussed in <a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch11#ch11"><span
style='color:#003399'>Chapter 11</span></a>). In addition to regular
monitoring, the business manager also helps to resolve issues and problems that
cannot be handled by the project team and are <span class=docemphasis1>escalated</span>
to his level (escalation is discussed in <a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch08#ch08"><span
style='color:#003399'>Chapter 8</span></a>). The business manager also
interacts with customers to ensure that they are satisfied and that any issues
are promptly raised and addressed.</p>

<p class=doctext>In addition, other senior people also review projects
periodically by regularly taking part in internal audits (discussed in <a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch11#ch11"><span
style='color:#003399'>Chapter 11</span></a>). Through two systems—called PRISM
(project review by senior management) and IPM (integrated project
management)—milestone reports and project plans are available for senior
management to review. All senior managers are expected to review some projects
periodically through this system and to give feedback to the project leaders.</p>

<p class=doctext>Overall, senior management maintains involvement in the
project primarily by monitoring to ensure that the project objectives are met
and that the customer is fully satisfied.</p>

<h4><a name=ch01lev2sec6></a><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:Arial'>1.3.4
Training for Project Managers</span></h4>

<p class=doctext>Because project managers have the main responsibility for
satisfying the customer, they need to master not only executing the technical
aspects of a project but also interacting with customers, eliciting
requirements, managing the team, and so on. Clearly no one is likely to possess
all the skills needed, so it's crucial to train people to develop the necessary
skills. Infosys has implemented a variety of programs to help people transition
from being engineers to being project leaders.</p>

<p class=doctext>All fresh entrants undergo a three- to four-month <span
class=docemphasis1>induction training program.</span> In addition to training
in engineering and technology, this program contains one- or two-day programs
in business etiquette, written communication, public speaking, body language,
and so on.</p>

<p class=doctext>Later, when engineers are ready to become <span
class=docemphasis1>module leaders</span> (those who manage the development of a
system module, especially in larger projects) or project managers, they attend
a series of technical and soft-skills training programs. Included in the former
is a five-day project management course that focuses on all aspects of project
management: planning, monitoring, controlling, and so on. A two-week course on
requirements specification and management teaches how to elicit requirements,
how to document them, how to verify them, and so on. The five-day residential
soft-skills training program includes modules on appraisals and team
management, customer focus and customer management, leadership, social and
business etiquette for different countries, and so on.</p>

<p class=doctext>Other regularly offered programs focus on various aspects of
management; project leaders take these courses when their schedules permit.
Also, team-building workshops are conducted by professionals.</p>

<h4><a name=ch01lev2sec7></a><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:Arial'>1.3.5
The Project Management Process</span></h4>

<p class=doctext>For a project team to successfully execute a project, it must
perform hundreds of tasks, many of them interdependent. Effectively managing
this process is extremely important for success. At Infosys, the set of
activities executed by a project manager is specified in the <span
class=docemphasis1>project management</span> process. It is fairly standard,
having three main stages:</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Project planning</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Project execution</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Project closure</p>

<p class=doctext>In the <span class=docemphasis1>project planning</span> stage,
the project manager reviews contractual commitments and creates a plan to meet
them. Creating a project plan involves defining a life-cycle process to be
followed, estimating the effort and schedule, preparing a detailed schedule of
tasks, and so on. It also includes planning for quality and configuration
management as well as risk management. In this phase, the major activities of
the project manager are as follows:</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span></span>Create a project plan and schedule.</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt'>- Define the project objectives.</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt'>- Identify a suitable standard
process for project execution.</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt'>- Tailor the standard process to
meet project requirements.</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt'>- Define a process for managing
changes in requirements.</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt'>- Estimate the effort.</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt'>- Plan for human resources and team
organization.</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt'>- Define the project milestones and
create a schedule.</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt'>- Define the quality objectives and
a quality plan to achieve them.</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt'>- Make a defect prevention plan.</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt'>- Identify risks and make plans to
mitigate them.</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt'>- Define a measurement plan for the
project.</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt'>- Define a training plan for the
project.</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt'>- Define project-tracking
procedures.</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Orient the project team to the project
management plan.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>In addition to the project manager, this
phase involves the customer, an SEPG representative, and the business manager
for the project. The entry criterion is that the contract or project
authorization is available. The exit criterion is that the project plan has
been documented and group reviewed (see </span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch10#ch10"><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>Chapter 10</span></a><span lang=EN-GB>).</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The second phase, <span class=docemphasis1>project
execution,</span> involves executing the project plan, tracking the status of
the project, and making corrections whenever project performance strays from
the path laid down in the project plan. In other words, it involves tracking
and controlling the implementation of the project process. This phase is the
longest in the project management process, incorporating periodic tasks such as
monitoring project status and quality and taking any needed corrective steps. In
this phase, the project manager performs these main activities:</span></p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><a

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Other members of the team also participate in
this stage. The entry criterion is that the project plan is complete and
approved, and the exit criterion is that all work products delivered are
accepted by the customer.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The last stage of the project management
process, <span class=docemphasis1>project closure,</span> involves a systematic
wind-up of the project after customer acceptance. The main goal here is to
learn from the experience so that the process can be improved. Post-project
data analysis constitutes the main activity; metrics are analyzed, process
assets (materials, such as templates and guidelines, used to aid in managing
the process itself) are collected for future use, and lessons are recorded. Because
learning from the project is the main goal, this is a group activity that
involves the project manager, the SEPG, and other members of the team. The
entry criterion is that the customer has accepted the work products. The exit
criterion is that a postproject meeting has been conducted. The main outputs of
this phase are the project closure report and the collected process assets.</span></p>
