<h2><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:16.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Chapter 2. The
Project Planning Infrastructure</span></h2>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>At the end of his tenth project plan review
meeting, Dinesh, the head of delivery at Infosys at the time, was not very
happy. In review after review of project plans, Dinesh had noted that each
project manager was working in a world of his own, valiantly struggling to
create optimum processes to execute his project and to produce estimates that
he could meet—this even though Dinesh knew that similar projects had been
executed earlier by other teams whose experience and data could considerably
ease the project manager's pain. Not only were the project managers investing
their planning effort in reinventing the wheel, but also they were
&quot;planning&quot; to make the same mistakes as the project managers before
them. Dinesh realized that the answer to this predicament lay in creating an
institutional memory that would be accessible to all project managers.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The million dollar question was how to build
this institutional memory and use it to mold an infrastructure for project
planning. What were its elements? How should past experience be systematically
recorded and made available for reuse? How could Infosys keep the
infrastructure current?</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>This chapter discusses the key elements of
the planning infrastructure at Infosys: the process database, the process
capability baseline, and the process assets. In later chapters you will see how
these elements are used in project planning.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The <span class=docemphasis1>process database</span>
(PDB) captures the performance data of completed projects. The <span
class=docemphasis1>process capability baseline</span> (PCB) summarizes the
performance across projects. It thereby specifies quantitatively the range of
results that have been obtained by following the processes, and therefore the
range of results to be expected if the same processes are followed. <span
class=docemphasis1>Process assets</span> are documents such as checklists,
templates, methodologies, and lessons learned—materials that capture past
experience and help project managers and engineers use the processes
effectively. These components are usually present in high-maturity
organizations, although their use in these organizations differs.</span><a
