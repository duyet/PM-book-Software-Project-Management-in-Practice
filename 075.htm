<h3><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Arial'>11.5 PROCESS
MONITORING AND AUDIT</span></h3>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>To gain the benefits of plans and processes,
projects must follow them properly. People can make mistakes, and under
deadline pressures they tend to take shortcuts or expedient measures, often
failing to follow processes correctly. To ensure compliance with the defined
processes, an active effort is needed. Audits aim to fulfill this need.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The basic objective of audits is to ensure
compliance with the defined process and to provide senior management with
visibility into the use of processes. To ensure a reasonable degree of
compliance, audits must be done regularly. They also must be formal, with a
formal notice of noncompliance being issued and later tracked to satisfactory
closure. Formality ensures that &quot;personal equations&quot; do not play a
major role and that senior management gains visibility into process compliance
through summary audit reports.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Who should conduct the audits? Ideally, the
auditors should understand the processes of the organization and their importance,
and should have the necessary maturity and stature to be able to assess the
implementation on a project objectively. The auditors also need to be trained
in the process of auditing.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>At Infosys, project personnel from other
projects perform the audit of a project, with SEPG providing the training. Every
month, the audit coordinator announces an audit schedule that specifies which
project is to be audited by whom and the focus area for the audit (which aspect
of the process the audit should focus on). A team of two people normally
conducts the audit.</span></p>

<h4><a name=ch11lev2sec13></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>11.5.1 Conducting the Audit</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>In the audit, the auditors focus on whether
the defined process is being followed in the project, paying greatest attention
to the processes in the audit's focus area. They ask questions about how an
activity is done, and they look at the evidence or outputs of these activities.
They may use <span class=docemphasis1>audit checklists</span> to determine the
questions. These checklists are derived from the approved processes and past
experience, and they try to maximize the returns from an audit by concentrating
on the key aspects rather than less important or peripheral issues. </span>Here
are parts of the checklist for project planning:</p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Are reviews, progress reporting, tracking, and

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The audit is considered complete when the
audit team has asked all questions and looked at any desired artifacts. A
noncompliance report (NCR) is issued if the evidence suggests that the approved
processes are not being followed, or that some weaknesses exist in the process
that might lead to loss of control or to suboptimality.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>A key aspect of auditing (and one that is
stressed in training) is that the procedure seeks to audit the compliance to
the process and not to audit people. This idea is fundamental to the entire
process-oriented approach; the focus should always remain on the process and
process improvement, and problems found in a project should be attributed to
process factors and not to people. The NCR clearly indicates the type of
deviation found.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Identifying noncompliance is the goal of
audits (and the analysis of audit results is used to evaluate the effectiveness
of processes), but when two software professionals evaluate a project, they are
likely to develop some ideas regarding the project's technical or management
aspects that might be useful in improving the project. These issues often do
not constitute noncompliance, but one would not like to lose this insight. Such
observations are therefore recorded on a separate form as the auditors'
suggestions. The audit reports, including NCRs and suggestions, are sent to the
coordinator of audits.</span></p>

<h4><a name=ch11lev2sec14></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>11.5.2 Follow-up Actions</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The submission of the NCR is not the end of
the auditing activity. Because the audit's basic purpose is to ensure that
projects deploy the organization's approved processes, these reports should be
used to make the necessary changes in the project so that any issue raised in
the NCR is satisfactorily addressed. This step is called a <span
class=docemphasis1>corrective action</span>. For each NCR, some corrective
action must be taken. Once taken, it is recorded on the NCR form itself.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>To ensure that the issue raised in the NCR is
satisfactorily resolved, the audit coordinator ensures that the action is
approved by the auditors. If these personnel are not available, the quality
adviser for the project or the audit coordinator may approve the action. Once
the action is approved, the NCR is considered closed.</span></p>

lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>Figure 11.10</span></a><span lang=EN-GB> gives
an example of an NCR and its corrective action. This NCR specifies the project,
the date, and the severity of the noncompliance. The severity indicates both
the seriousness of the issue and its consequences (major or minor). Project
personnel usually take the corrective action. In this case, the issue raised
concerned requirements changes, which are handled generally by the project
manager, who therefore instituted the corrective action. The date of the
corrective action is also mentioned.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Sometimes, the issue is likely to recur,
either in the same project or in other projects. In that case, in addition
taking a corrective action, the project may need to take a preventive action to
ensure that a similar problem does not crop up again. Hence, preventive actions
might need to be taken in some situations. The NCR includes a section in which
to record the preventive actions taken and who took them. </span><a
href="http:// /JVXSL.asp?x=1&amp;mode=section&amp;sortKey=insertDate&amp;sortOrder=desc&amp;view=book&amp;xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch11lev1sec5&amp;open=true&amp;title=New%20This%20Week&amp;catid=&amp;s=1&amp;b=1&amp;f=1&amp;t=1&amp;c=1&amp;u=1#ch11fig11#ch11fig11"><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>Figure 11.11</span></a><span lang=EN-GB> shows
an example of an NCR that required both corrective and preventive action. The
preventive action for this NCR is to upgrade a checklist to ensure that a
similar problem does not happen in the future.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>At Infosys, an NCR must be closed within 60
days of the audit. Typically, the audit coordinator sends a reminder at the end
of one month and another one a week before the time limit expires. NCRs older
than 60 days are reported to the senior management for the project. This kind
of formal follow-up ensures that audit reports are taken seriously and that the
issues raised are addressed properly.</span></p>
