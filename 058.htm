<h3><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Arial'>9.2 THE
CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PROCESS</span></h3>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The CM process defines the sequence of
activities that must be performed in support of the CM mechanisms. As with most
activities in project management, the first stage in the CM process at Infosys
is planning—identifying those items that need to be under CM (known as <span
class=docemphasis1>configuration items</span>), locations to store them,
procedures for change control, and so on. The project manager or the
configuration controller (CC) of the project prepares this plan. Then the
process must be executed, perhaps by deploying a tool (the use of which also
must be planned). Finally, because any CM plan requires discipline on the part
of the project personnel in terms of maintaining versions, storing items in
proper locations, and making changes properly, monitoring the status of the
configuration items and performing CM audits are therefore other activities in
the CM process. This chapter discusses these three activities of the CM process
at Infosys.</span></p>

<h4><a name=ch09lev2sec1></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>9.2.1 Planning and Setting Up Configuration Management</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Planning for configuration management
involves identifying the configuration items and specifying the procedures to
be used for controlling and implementing changes to them. Identifying
configuration items is a fundamental activity in any type of CM.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch09lev1sec5#ch09entry02"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>2</span></sup></a><sup><span lang=EN-GB>,</span></sup><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch09lev1sec5#ch09entry03"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>3</span></sup></a><sup><span lang=EN-GB>,</span></sup><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch09lev1sec5#ch09entry04"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>4</span></sup></a><span lang=EN-GB> Typical
examples of configuration items include requirements specifications, design
documents, source code, test plans, test scripts, test procedures, test data,
standards used in the project (such as coding standards and design standards),
the acceptance plan, documents such as the CM plan and the project plan, user documentation
such as the user manual, and documents such as the training material, contract
documents (including support tools such as a compiler or in-house tools),
quality records (review records, test records), and CM records (release
records, status tracking records). Any customer-supplied products or purchased
items that will be part of the delivery (called &quot;included software
product&quot;) are also configuration items.</span></p>

<p class=doctext>During planning, the types of items that come under the aegis
of CM are identified, but a detailed list of items is not prepared. This
omission reflects the fact that some items may not be known during CM planning
(which occurs at the beginning of the project). To facilitate proper naming of
configuration items, the naming conventions for CM items are established during
the CM planning stages. In addition to naming standards, project managers must
plan version numbering. When a configuration item is changed, the old item is
not replaced with the new copy; instead, the old copy is maintained and a new
one is created. This approach results in multiple versions of an item, so
policies for version number assignment are needed. If a CM tool is being used,
sometimes the tool handles the version numbering. Otherwise, it must be
explicitly handled in the project.</p>

<p class=doctext>During planning, the project manager must decide how to
maintain the state of a program. One way of collecting items in different
states is to create separate directories for them. All items in a certain state
reside in the directory for that state. When the state of a program changes,
that program is moved from the directory for the old state to the directory for
the new state. This approach is a general one and does not require the use of
any tool to maintain the state information. If a CM tool is available, however,
the directory structure needed for managing the states of programs depends on
the tool. During the planning phase, project managers must set the directory
structure employed for managing the states, keeping in mind the requirements of
the CM tool, if any.</p>

<p class=doctext>The configuration controller or the project manager does the
CM planning. It is begun only when the project has been initiated and the
operating environment and requirements specifications are clearly documented.
The activities in this stage include the following:</p>

<p class=doctext>The output of this phase is the CM plan. The CC is responsible
for the implementation of the CM plan. Depending on the size of the system
under development, the CC's role may be a part-time or a full-time job. The CC
can also be responsible for managing the release, archiving the release,
retrieving and releasing appropriate versions when required, and more.</p>

<p class=doctext>In certain cases—when there are large teams or when two or
more teams or groups are involved in the development of the same or different
portions of the software or interfacing systems—it may be necessary to have a
CCB. This board includes representatives from each of the teams. A CCB (or a
CC) is considered essential for CM,<a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch09lev1sec5#ch09entry03"><sup><span
style='color:#003399'>3</span></sup></a> and the CM plan must clearly define
the roles and responsibilities of the CC or CCB. These duties also depend on
the type of file system and tools being used.</p>

<p class=doctext>As noted earlier, CM requires that access to some items in
some states remain restricted. For example, the programmers' access and right
to modify a program in the baseline must be limited. Planning activities must
therefore specify the access rights of the CC, the project manager, and the
developers.</p>

<p class=doctext>Policies and procedures for change control are also
established during planning. This includes controlling normal changes that take
place during the life cycle as well as changes that are driven by requirement
changes. Normal changes are generally managed through a library mechanism and
directory structure. Changes due to requirement change requests, which may
necessitate that many programs be changed, are frequently tracked through a
spreadsheet that lists all items that must be changed as well as the directory
for each item (thereby giving its state).</p>

<p class=doctext>If project managers allow concurrent updates to programs, they
must specify reconciliation procedures. Concurrent updates are sometimes
necessary. For example, suppose a high-priority change request comes in at the
same time that another change request is being implemented. Clearly, the new
change request cannot be put on hold until the first one is finished.
Similarly, if problems occur in the working system while a change request is
being implemented, then changes must be made immediately to ensure that the
system can continue to function. For such situations, reconciliation procedures
are needed.</p>

<p class=doctext>One possible procedure is to state that the differences
between the original version and the new versions will be examined, and the
changes in the version having fewer changes will be merged in the other
version. If the changes affect different parts of the program, merging is
straightforward; some CM tools readily support this capability. Otherwise, the
programmer must review the overlap and then accommodate both changes.</p>

<p class=doctext>All elements of the plan are documented in the CM plan. Later
in this chapter we give the CM plan for the ACIC project.</p>

<h4><a name=ch09lev2sec2></a><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:Arial'>9.2.2
Perform Configuration Control</span></h4>

<p class=doctext>Although configuration control activities are undertaken
during the execution phase of the project, we discuss them here along with
other aspects of CM. Two main configuration control activities are performed:
one that deals with managing the state transitions of programs (and documents),
and one that deals with managing the change requests that must be implemented.</p>

<p class=doctext>State transition management involves moving the items from one
directory to another when the state changes and then creating versions when
changes are made.</p>

<p class=doctext>Frequently, tools are used to manage the states and versions
of items and access to them. Many CM tools employ the check-in/check-out
procedure for controlling access and handling version control. The basic idea
behind this approach is as follows. A program is considered to be in a <span
class=docemphasis1>controlled environment</span> when it is in any state in
which others can use it. Once a program is in the controlled environment, it
cannot be modified, even by the original author, without proper <span
class=docemphasis1>authorization</span>, because others may be using it. To
make an approved change, the developer must check the program out of the
controlled environment. Checking out essentially implies making a copy of the
item without destroying the earlier version, and making a note that the item
has been checked out.</p>

<p class=doctext>An item is modified after it has been checked out. The
modifications must then be reflected in the controlled environment so that
others have the benefit of the new version and so that the change request
(which may have forced the changes) can be truly implemented. Because other
team members may be using the items, some checks are done to ensure that the
changed item is suitable before it is checked back in. When an item is checked
back into the controlled environment, the older copy is not destroyed; instead,
a new version is created. Often, only the CC or the project leader can check
items in. This limitation makes it possible to roll back the changes if the need
arises.</p>

<p class=doctext>To provide information about changes that have been made,
project managers can opt to keep a modification log in the program source
itself. This log essentially identifies the start and end of a change and
includes a reference to the change request that prompted it.</p>

<p class=doctext>All these tasks—checking in, checking out, version
maintenance, and creation of a modification log—can be handled through the use
of proper CM tools. Various tools are available that perform many aspects of
this CM library function.</p>

<p class=doctext>To implement requirement changes, which in turn trigger
changes to configuration items, a change request is first analyzed by
performing an impact analysis (discussed in <a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch03#ch03"><span
style='color:#003399'>Chapter 3</span></a>). This analysis determines the
programs and documents that need to be changed and the cost and schedule
implications of making the change. Once the change is approved by the project
leader and the CC, all programs and documents identified in the impact analysis
must be changed appropriately. The following activities are part of
implementing a change request:</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Accept the change request (with impact analysis).</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Set up a tracking mechanism.</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Check out configuration items that need to be changed.</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Perform the changes.</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Check in the configuration items.</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Take the item through its life cycle.</p>

<p class=doctext>A spreadsheet-based mechanism is frequently used for tracking
the status of change requests. For each change request, a spreadsheet is
created that lists all programs being changed and their status. To implement a
change, the CC or CCB assigns modifications to different items as tasks to
members of the team, who check the items out so as to make these changes. After
a team member makes a change, the changed program (or document) can be viewed
as a new program that must go through different states (representing the life
cycle of the program) before it can become part of the final in-operation
system. Once all altered programs and their associated documents reach the baseline
(after following their life cycle), the change request is considered to be
fully implemented.</p>

<h4><a name=ch09lev2sec3></a><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:Arial'>9.2.3
Status Monitoring and Audits</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>A configuration item can exist in one of
several states. The set of possible states varies according to whether the item
is a program or a document and the type of CM tools being used. It is important
to accurately represent the state of each item because state-related mistakes
can lead to problems. For example, if a program has not been unit tested but is
moved to the state &quot;ready for release,&quot; it can cause problems. Similarly,
if the system fails to reflect the fact that a program has been checked out
from the baseline to implement a change, the software might be delivered
without the change. Thus, when a requirement change request is implemented, it
is also important that the mechanisms used to capture the state accurately
represent the state.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>If projects use a mechanism based on a
directory structure to represent the state of a program, mistakes are possible.
This type of mechanism requires that the programs be moved properly from one
directory to another when their state changes and that the change of state be
reflected in the master table that maintains the states of the various items. To
minimize mistakes and catch any errors early, projects must perform regular
status checking of the configuration items. A report can be produced about the
discrepancies, and all such discrepancies must be resolved.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>In addition to checking the status of the
items, projects must check the status of change requests. To accomplish this
goal, change requests that have been received since the last CM status
monitoring operation are examined. For each change request, the state of the
item as mentioned in the change request records is compared to the actual
state. Checks can also be done to ensure that all modified items go through
their full life cycle (that is, the state diagram) before they are incorporated
in the baseline.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Finally, projects can perform a configuration
audit. As in other audits, the main focus here is to ensure that the CM process
of the project is indeed being followed. The baseline for the system can also
be audited to ensure that its integrity is not being violated and that items
are moved to and from the baseline in a manner consistent with the CM plans.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The project's configuration controller
generally conducts the CM audits. After a CM audit, a report is usually issued
that lists what needs to be done to keep the CM activities consistent with the
CM plan. </span><a
