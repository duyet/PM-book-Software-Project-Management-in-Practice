ACTIVITY-LEVEL ANALYSIS USING SPC</span></h3>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Milestone analysis uses metrics to monitor
the state of the project at defined milestones and to suggest corrective
actions if needed. However, with milestone-based analysis, it is hard to
determine which of the many activities performed since the last milestone may
be the cause of performance degradation. This situation is similar to
performing system testing; debugging is much harder when the system comprises
many units. It is far easier to debug during unit testing. This difficulty in
pinning down the cause of poor performance limits the corrective actions that
can be taken.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>To provide finer control, activity-level
analysis is also done at Infosys. In activity-level analysis, some metrics are
analyzed immediately after a task is performed. The analysis is used to
evaluate the effectiveness of the task performance. If the task has not been
performed satisfactorily, immediate action can be taken to correct it and to
prevent a repetition.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Activity-level analysis is usually done using
statistical process control (SPC). At Infosys, reviews and unit testing have
been identified as the two tasks for which SPC is applied. Using control
charts, the project manager immediately evaluates the effectiveness of a review
or a unit test. If the performance is not satisfactory, necessary action can be
taken.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Note that the broad activities of design,
detailed design, system testing, and so on are already evaluated individually
through milestone analysis because they typically start and finish at
milestones. Hence, the focus of activity-level monitoring is on the
coding-related activities of reviews and unit testing.</span></p>

explains the monitoring and control of reviews using SPC. Here we discuss
activity-level monitoring and control of unit testing—the other activity for
which SPC is applied. The approach for unit testing is similar to that used for
monitoring reviews. The main performance characteristic that is monitored is
the density of defects detected in unit testing. From the past data on unit
testing, the control limits (that is, the range of acceptable density) are
obtained. At the end of each unit test, the defect density is checked against
the range. If it falls outside the limits, corrective or preventive actions may
have to be taken. The guidelines given earlier for testing can be used to
decide which actions are needed (for analysis, project managers can use
supporting information about effort spent on the task, effort expended on
previous tasks, and defects found). </span><a

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>As with reviews, project managers can use the
SPC tool to implement activity-level control of unit testing. This tool
contains relevant past performance data such as the defect injection rate, the
defect removal percentage, and so on. Using this data, it determines the
control limits as well as expected limits. When the performance data of a unit
test is entered, the tool immediately tells whether or not the performance is
outside the limits. If it is outside the limits, further analysis must be done
to determine what action, if any, should be taken.</span></p>
