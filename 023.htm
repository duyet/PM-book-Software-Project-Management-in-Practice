<h2><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:16.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Chapter 4.
Effort Estimation and Scheduling</span></h2>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>In early 2000, the newspapers and TV in </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>India</span><span lang=EN-GB> reported with jubilation the
successful test flight of a newly built light combat aircraft. But the detailed
reports also indicated a somber side: The prototype delivery was more than five
years late, and the project had cost more than 10 times its initial estimated
cost. Many projects across the world suffer a similar fate. It seems as if the
estimated cost and time are never enough to execute a project. Improper
estimation is the bane of project management in many engineering disciplines,
and software engineering is no different, as the poor record of software
projects unambiguously illustrates.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>In a services business, improper estimation
hurts even more. Asked to identify the one thing he wants from projects, Nandan
Nilekeni, the managing director of Infosys, answers, &quot;No surprises.&quot; No
surprises on the customer satisfaction front, and no surprises on the revenue
and profit front. More often than not, the cause of surprises that come late in
a project on these two fronts is improper estimation of effort or schedule.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>There are no quick and ready-made solutions
for the estimation problem. Project managers, however, can improve their
estimation by using tested guidelines that are based on past experience and
data. This chapter discusses the approaches used by Infosys project managers
for estimating effort and schedule. It includes examples from real projects and
the estimates for the ACIC case study.</span></p>
