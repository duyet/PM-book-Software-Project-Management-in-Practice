<h2><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:16.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Preface</span></h2>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The genesis of this book dates back to 1996. For
my sabbatical, I joined Infosys as the head of quality, with the charter of
improving the processes for project execution. Seeing the problems faced by
project managers, I felt that software project management must be the toughest
job on the planet. And I thought that delivering high-quality software within
budget and on schedule must be an oxymoron.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The situation, I now realize, is not quite
that hopeless. </span>By using sound project management processes, project
managers in some organizations are successfully executing projects.</p>

<p class=doctext>Infosys, one such global organization, has successfully
executed more than 500 projects last year alone. It has about 10,000 employees
spread across 25 cities in more than a dozen countries around the globe, and it
has been assessed at the highest maturity level (level 5) of the CMM. Its
revenues and profits have grown at about 75% per year for the past five years.
The level of customer satisfaction can be judged by the fact that despite the
company's huge growth about 85% of its revenue comes from repeat orders from
existing customers.</p>

<p class=doctext>I have used my experience and knowledge of Infosys processes
to cull out and describe in this book the key project management practices that
have been used to successfully execute project after project. The beauty of
these practices is that despite being highly effective, they are not complex;
rather, they are grounded in common sense and are supported by simple
measurements and analyses.</p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>In describing project management processes at
Infosys, the book offers a unique combination of two value propositions. First,
it provides the complete set of processes employed for project management in a
highly successful organization. The use of these processes is illustrated with
real examples and a running case study. Second, because the processes satisfy
the requirements of the Capability Maturity Model (CMM), this book demystifies
the way projects are managed in a high-maturity organization, and it provides
the benefits that the CMM offers to project management without the need of a
detailed understanding of the CMM.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The book is written primarily for project
managers and for professionals who plan to become project managers. By using
the methods described in this book they can systematically improve the planning
and execution of their projects. It can also be very useful for an organization
that wants to reach a high maturity level. If project managers start using the
methods described here, they will lay the foundations for high maturity in the
organization.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Because most chapters begin with an overview
before describing the details of the Infosys method, this book can also be used
as a text in a software project management course. In a general software
engineering course, it can serve as a supplementary text, providing a view of
how a software project is managed in a business environment.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><a

lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>Chapter 1</span></a><span lang=EN-GB> contains
a brief introduction to Infosys and the relationship of the CMM and project
management. The remainder of the book is divided into two parts. </span><a

lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>Part I</span></a><span lang=EN-GB>, consisting

lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>9</span></a><span lang=EN-GB>, focuses on
project planning and covers topics such as planning infrastructure, process
planning, effort and schedule estimation, quality planning, risk management,
measurement planning, and configuration management. </span><a

lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>Part II</span></a><span lang=EN-GB>,

lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>12</span></a><span lang=EN-GB>, focuses on
project execution and completion and covers reviews, project monitoring and
control, and project closure.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>To the extent possible, each chapter has been
kept independent and stand-alone and has been organized as follows. The
relevant concepts and background material are given in the first section,
followed by a discussion of methods used by Infosys. Next come examples of the
use of these methods in real projects and in the case study. Each chapter ends
with a summary that lists the key takeaways from the chapter and describes
which aspects of CMM are satisfied by the methods discussed in the chapter.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Although this book draws on my earlier book <span
class=docemphasis1>CMM in Practice</span> (Addison-Wesley, 2000), it has a
different focus and substantially different contents. Whereas <span
class=docemphasis1>CMM in Practice</span> considers the entire software process
and focuses on implementation of the CMM in an organization, this book focuses
exclusively on project management.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Many people helped to make this book a
reality. Because the book has its origins in <span class=docemphasis1>CMM in
Practice</span>, my thanks to all the people who helped in that project. In
addition, I would like to again express my gratitude to Infosys and its
directors, whose cooperation and help made this book possible. My sincere
thanks to members of the quality department at Infosys for providing
information whenever needed, and to the many people who shared with me their
experiences, which find their way into mini-cases throughout the book (although
with the names changed). My special thanks to Naresh Agarwal for his help with
the main case study, and to Sanjay Joshi for his help in bringing a sharper
focus to the chapters. And finally, my thanks to my wife, Shikha, and my
daughters, Sumedha and Sunanda, for bearing with me and my odd hours once
again.</span></p>
