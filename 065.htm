<h3><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Arial'>10.2 DATA
COLLECTION</span></h3>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Data collection during reviews is crucial. You
have already seen that at various stages in the process, data are recorded. Because
reviews are largely human processes, if data are not properly recorded, the
information can easily be lost. In addition to logging the defects identified
by the review process, effort data must also be captured. Detailed defect data
are needed for tracking defects in the project. The overall defect and effort
data are needed for analyzing the effectiveness of the review and for
constructing the review capability baseline. Hence, the summary data for each
review are maintained in a review database. This section describes the key
forms used for data collection during reviews at Infosys.</span></p>

font-family:Arial'>10.2.1 Self-Preparation Log</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Reviewers use the <span class=docemphasis1>self-preparation
log</span> to record all defects or issues found during their independent
reviews. The effort spent during the reviews is also recorded. Each reviewer
prepares this log. In addition to identifying the project, the work product,
the reviewer, and other facts, entries in the log specify the location of the
issue or defect and the reviewer's assessment regarding its seriousness or
criticality. The form shown in </span><a

<h4><a name=ch10lev2sec8></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>10.2.2 Group Review Meeting Log</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The scribe prepares a log of the group review
meeting that lists the defects and issues that were identified during the
meeting. Hence, it includes all defects found by individual reviewers in their
self-reviews that were validated as defects or issues during the meeting, as
well as the additional defects found during the meeting. Unlike the
self-preparation log, which lists defects as perceived by a reviewer, the group
review meeting log lists only those defects that have been agreed to by the
author. In other words, it lists actual defects found, and it is the official
defects list of the review.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>In addition to each defect's location and
description, its severity is recorded in this log. The severity reflects the
consensus of the group review team. As discussed in </span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch07#ch07"><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>Chapter 7</span></a><span lang=EN-GB>, the
severity of a defect can be either critical, major, minor, or cosmetic. If it
can be determined at which stage the defect was injected, this information can
also be recorded, as can the type of the defect.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The issues raised are listed in a separate
log. For each issue, a person is assigned to resolve it. This log also contains
the total effort spent (in person-hours) in the meeting.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><a
href="http:// /JVXSL.asp?x=1&amp;mode=section&amp;sortKey=insertDate&amp;sortOrder=desc&amp;view=book&amp;xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch10lev1sec2&amp;open=true&amp;title=New%20This%20Week&amp;catid=&amp;s=1&amp;b=1&amp;f=1&amp;t=1&amp;c=1&amp;u=1#ch10fig03#ch10fig03"><span

<h4><a name=ch10lev2sec9></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>10.2.3 Group Review Summary Report</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The defects log is used to track all defects
to closure. To analyze the effectiveness of a review, however, only
summary-level information is needed. This information is also needed for
updating the review baseline. For process improvement and understanding of the
review process, the group review summary report is the most important element. Hence,
this information is maintained in a separate review database that is available
for analysis.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The summary report describes the work
product; the total effort spent and the amounts spent in each of the review
process activities; the total number of defects found for each category; and
the size of the work product being reviewed. If the types of defects were
recorded, the number of defects in each category can be recorded in the
summary. In addition to the data on effort and defects, the summary contains
suggestions for the next phase. Finally, the summary indicates whether a
re-review is needed. A completed summary report is shown later in this chapter.</span></p>
