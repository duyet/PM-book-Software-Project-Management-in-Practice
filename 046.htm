<h3><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Arial'>7.3 PROJECT
TRACKING</span></h3>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The main goal of tracking is for project
managers to get visibility into the project execution so that they can
determine whether any action needs to be taken to ensure that the project goals
are met. Because meeting the established project goals is the basic motive, all
aspects of project execution that can affect the attainment of the goals must
be monitored, and this monitoring must be planned. At Infosys, project managers
typically plan for the following tracking:</span></p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Activities tracking</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Defect tracking</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Issues tracking</p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Activities tracking looks at which planned
activities have been completed. If the granularity of an activity is small,
then at the lowest level you consider it to be in one of two states: not done
or fully done. For higher-level tasks, you can compute the percentage completed
from the state of the lowest-level tasks and their estimates.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Defect tracking is done in connection with
defect logging, as discussed earlier.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Issues tracking ensures that clarifications
and other problems that have the potential to delay the project do not go out
of control. </span><a

lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>Chapter 11</span></a><span lang=EN-GB>
explains how these tracking activities are performed at Infosys. During
planning, project managers specify what type of tracking they plan to do and
what tools or methods they will use.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>In addition, to keep track of the project's
status along the effort, schedule, and quality dimensions, project managers
also plan for the following:</span></p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Activity-level monitoring</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Status reports</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Milestone reports</p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Activity-level monitoring ensures that each
activity has been done properly. You monitor activities quantitatively through
the use of statistical process control. Based on past performance, you
establish limits for key performance parameters of certain tasks. Then you
compare actual performance of an activity to the established limits. If the
performance is not within acceptable limits, you might take certain actions. At
Infosys, reviews and unit testing, discussed in </span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch10#ch10"><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>Chapters 10</span></a><span lang=EN-GB> and </span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch11#ch11"><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>11</span></a><span lang=EN-GB>, are the two
main activities that employ this approach.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Status reports are usually prepared weekly to
help you to take stock of what has happened and what needs to be done. At
project milestones, you conduct a more elaborate exercise to quantitatively
check the actual versus estimated data along the effort, schedule, and defect
dimensions. In addition, you monitor risks, training, reviews, customer
complaints, and so on. The milestone analysis plays an important role in
controlling the project. To ensure that the milestone analysis is done often
enough to allow timely intervention, if the milestones required by the customer
are too far apart, you plan internal milestones so that a milestone analysis is
done every three to five weeks.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>At milestones, you analyze actual versus
estimated for effort, schedule, and defects. If the deviation is significant,
some corrective action is called for. To differentiate the normal from the
significant, you specify the acceptable deviation limits; to set these limits,
you employ concepts of control charts. Control limits have been defined at
Infosys for effort and schedule deviation (between the actual and estimated). These
values, originally based on judgment and experience, are now based on past data
and are computed in the same manner as other control limits. The earlier limits
were 35% for effort deviation and 15% for schedule; with improvements in the
process, these limits have been reduced to 20% and 10%, respectively. </span><a

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>If the deviation at the milestone exceeds
these limits, it may imply that the project may run into trouble and might not
meet its objectives; under time pressure, the project team might therefore
start taking undesirable shortcuts. This situation calls for project managers
to understand the reasons for the variation and to apply corrective and
preventive actions if necessary.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>These limits are based on past data and
experience. You must set your project's own limits, which may be higher than
the organization's limits, during planning.</span></p>
