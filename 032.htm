<h3><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Arial'>5.3 DEFECT
PREVENTION PLANNING</span></h3>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Defect prevention (DP) activities are
intended to improve quality and improve productivity. It is now generally
accepted that some defects present in the system will not be detected by the
various QC activities and will inevitably find their way into the final system.
Consequently, the higher the number of defects introduced in the software
during development, the higher the number of residual defects that will remain
in the final delivered system.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>This point can be stated in another way. The
overall defect removal efficiency of a process is the percentage of total
defects that are removed by the various QC activities before the software is delivered.
For a stable process, the defect removal efficiency is also generally stable. Hence,
the greater the total number of defects in the system, the greater the number
of defects in the delivered system. In other words, the higher the defect
injection rate, the poorer the quality. Clearly, for a given process and its
removal efficiency, the quality of the final delivered software can be improved
if fewer defects are introduced while the software is being built. This
recognition serves as the quality motivation for defect prevention.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>DP also has productivity benefits. As
discussed earlier, the basic defect cycle during the building of software is
that developers introduce defects and later identify and remove them. In other
words, something is introduced that is later removed. Clearly, this defect
injection and removal cycle is a waste of effort—it adds no value to the
software. In this cycle, developers introduce something only to put in more
effort to remove it (and they hope they remove all the errors). It therefore
makes sense not to introduce defects in the first place; then the effort
required to identify and remove them will not be needed. In other words, if you
inject fewer defects, fewer defects must be removed; the effort required to
remove defects, in turn, will be reduced, thereby increasing productivity. This
concept serves as the cost motivation for DP.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>How is DP done? The premise of DP is that
there is some cause behind the injected defects. If the cause can be
understood, efforts can be made to eliminate defects or minimize their impact. In
other words, DP generally entails collecting data on defects found in the past,
analyzing the data to find the root causes for the injection of the defects,
and then developing solutions that attack the root causes.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Like any other major project task, the DP
activities must be planned. You actually analyze defects and find solutions,
however, after some amount of defect data from the project is available. To
implement DP, a project manager may start with the set of recommendations
available at the organization level and then build project-specific
recommendations based on analysis of the project's defect data. At Infosys, the
following steps are taken for defect prevention activities at the project
level:</span></p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>- Submit all
outputs of DP as a part of the process assets.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>During quality planning, your only activities
are the planning activities. The activities under &quot;Do defect
prevention&quot; or &quot;Capture learning&quot; are done while the project is
executing or when it is finished. Here, we focus primarily on the tasks related
to planning. </span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch11#ch11"><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>Chapter 11</span></a><span lang=EN-GB>
describes the tasks under &quot;Do defect prevention&quot; in a discussion of
project monitoring.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Most of the activities relating to DP
planning are self-explanatory. A project manager identifies a team that will
perform the DP analysis (obviously, everyone in the project must perform the
actual solutions that are to be executed to prevent defects). A kick-off
meeting raises the awareness of team members and identifies the solutions that
may be available in the organization. If needed, the DP team is trained on DP
and causal analysis.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Setting the DP goals is a key planning
activity. As mentioned earlier, DP is viewed as a strategy to achieve higher
quality and productivity than the standard organization process can achieve. Hence,
if a project manager has set quality and productivity goals that are higher
than the organization level, as part of her strategy to achieve the goals she
may use DP. In general, a project manager sets the DP goal in terms of
reduction in the defect injection rate, typically about 10% to 20%. With this
rate, its impact on quality and productivity can be estimated.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The other key planning activity is to decide
when and how often DP tasks will be performed. Although a project manager can
make these decisions, the general guideline at Infosys is that the DP
activities should be carried out after about 20% of the programs have been
coded, code reviewed, and unit tested, and again when about 50% of them have
been coded, reviewed, and unit tested. That is, the first DP exercise is
undertaken when the defect data from about 20% of the modules are available. Hopefully,
the results of this DP should result in actions that will reduce the defect
injection rate for the rest of the project. Then another DP exercise should be
done at the 50% mark. In this exercise the project manager can determine
whether the solutions are bearing results and whether further actions need to
be taken. At this point of development, all the different types of defects
should have been seen and their causes understood and acted on. </span>Hence,
further analysis will yield little new information.</p>
