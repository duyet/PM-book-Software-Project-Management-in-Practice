<h3><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Arial'>3.2 REQUIREMENT
CHANGE MANAGEMENT</span></h3>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Requirements change. And changes in
requirements can come at any time during the life of a project (or even after
that). The later in the life cycle the requirements change, the more severe the
impact on the project. Instead of wishing that changes will not happen or
hoping that somehow the initial requirements will be &quot;so good&quot; that
no changes will be required, it is better to prepare to handle change requests
as and when they come. Uncontrolled changes to requirements can have an adverse
effect on the cost, schedule, and quality of the project. Requirement changes
can account for as much as 40% of the total cost.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch03lev1sec5#ch03entry08"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>8</span></sup></a></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Ravi realized the need for a change
management process the hard way. In an effort to please the customer, he
readily agreed to make the changes the customer requested. With no control on
change requests, the project experienced them at an increasing frequency. In
the end, after 60-hour weeks for the team members and an effort escalation of
more than 100%, Ravi barely finished the project. What's worse, he found that
the customer was still not satisfied because he thought that more changes would
have made the product better.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>In another project, Mary, a seasoned project
manager, recorded each change request her customer made on the phone or through
e-mail and informed the customer of the impact of the request on effort and
schedule. Not only did the frequency of change requests decrease with time, but
also the customer transferred many requests to the next release. The final
result? The project was completed in time, and the happy customer actually paid
for the extra effort that was incurred in implementing the change requests.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>This section discusses the requirement change
management process used at Infosys. This process defines the set of activities
that are performed when there are new requirements or changes to existing
requirements (we will call both of these changes in the requirements). Given
the experience of project managers such as Ravi and Mary, the change management
process is routinely used by project managers, and specifying it as part of the
project management plan is treated less as a planning exercise and more as
means for clarifying the process to customers and getting their buy-in.</span></p>

<h4><a name=ch03lev2sec4></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>3.2.1 The Change Management Process</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>During project planning, a project manager
decides which process is to be followed for handling change requests. The
planned process is discussed with the customer so that both the customer and
the vendor are in agreement about how to manage changes. Generally, the process
specifies how the change requests will be made, when formal approvals are
needed, and so on. When a request for a requirements change comes in, the
requirements change management process must be executed.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Because change requests have cost
implications, it is necessary to have a clear agreement on payment. Frequently,
with customer approval, projects build a buffer into their estimates for
implementing change requests (typically a small percentage of the total project
effort). Such a budget provision simplifies the administrative aspects of
implementing approved change requests.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The commonly used change management process
at Infosys has the following steps.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>You maintain a change request log to keep
track of the change requests. Each entry in the log contains a change request
number, a brief description of the change, the effect of the change, the status
of the change request, and key dates. You assess the effect of a change request
by performing impact analysis. Impact analysis involves identifying work
products that need to be changed and evaluating the quantum of change to each;
reassessing the project's risks by revisiting the risk management plan; and
evaluating the overall implications of the changes for the effort and schedule
estimates. The outcome of the analysis is reviewed and approved by the
customer. The change requests are incorporated in the requirements
specification document, usually as appendixes. Sometimes the relevant portions
of the document are also modified to reflect the changes. Monitoring of
approved change requests and ensuring their proper implementation are handled
by the configuration management process, which is discussed in </span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch09#ch09"><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>Chapter 9</span></a><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>A change might be classified as minor if the
total effort involved in implementing it does not exceed a predetermined
value—say, two person-days. Minor changes typically become part of the project
effort, utilizing the buffer in the planned estimate. Major changes usually
have a larger impact on effort and schedule and must be formally approved by
the client. Senior management gains visibility in the changes through status
and milestone reporting, which are discussed in </span><a

<h4><a name=ch03lev2sec5></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>3.2.2 Examples</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>To specify the changes and the output of the
change management process, projects generally use a simple template. Each
change is assigned a unique reference number that is specified in the
template's <span class=docemphasis1>request number</span> field. The <span
class=docemphasis1>change specification field</span> gives a brief description
of the requested change. The category of the change (for example, design
change, contract change, functionality change, performance change) and the
nature of the change are specified as <span class=docemphasis1>change category.</span>
The summary of the <span class=docemphasis1>impact analysis</span> is recorded,
along with brief information regarding work products that will be affected, the
effort involved, and the implications for the schedule. The status of the
change request—what is being done with it—is recorded in the <span
class=docemphasis1>status field.</span> The date of the change request might
also be recorded, along with the date the change was approved, if approval is
needed. Generally, the projects customize this template to suit their needs.</span></p>

style='color:#003399'>Figure 3.3</span></a> shows a filled-in template for a
change request for the ACIC project. The various components in the template are
self-explanatory. This example is of a major change request that has an impact
on effort as well as schedule. The result of the impact analysis states the
impact on these dimensions. The analysis report also states that the customer
has approved the impact analysis (including the changes in effort and
schedule).</p>

<p class=doctext>Note that although the impact of a change request is specified,
and approved, by using the template, the actual tracking of implementation of a
change request is handled by the configuration management process, which is
discussed in <a href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch09#ch09"><span
style='color:#003399'>Chapter 9</span></a>.</p>

<p class=doctext>One danger of requirement changes is that, even though each
change is not large in itself, over the life of the project the cumulative
impact of the changes is large. Hence, in addition to studying the impact of
and tracking individual changes, you must monitor the cumulative impact of
changes. For cumulative changes, a <span class=docemphasis1>change log</span>
is used. To facilitate this analysis, the log is frequently maintained as a
spreadsheet. The example in <a
href="http:// /JVXSL.asp?x=1&amp;mode=section&amp;sortKey=insertDate&amp;sortOrder=desc&amp;view=book&amp;xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch03lev1sec2&amp;open=true&amp;title=New%20This%20Week&amp;catid=&amp;s=1&amp;b=1&amp;f=1&amp;t=1&amp;c=1&amp;u=1#ch03fig05#ch03fig05"><span
style='color:#003399'>Figure 3.5</span></a> illustrates how cumulative changes
are maintained. For details of each request, the relevant change request can be
accessed by using the change request number and date.</p>

<h5 align=center style='text-align:center'><a name=ch03fig05></a><span
style='font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Figure 3.5. Tracking the cumulative
effect of changes</span></h5>

<p class=doctext align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=500 height=496 src="019_files/image003.gif" alt="graphics/03fig05.gif"></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>From a spreadsheet of this type, you can
immediately see the total cost of the requirement changes made so far. As
mentioned earlier, Infosys project managers sometimes plan some buffer for
handling change requests. As long as the cumulative effort for all change
requests is less than this buffer, nothing special needs to be done. If the
cumulative effort of all changes exceeds this buffer, however, further changes
can have an adverse effect on total cost and scheduling. In this situation, the
project manager must revise the estimates and get them approved.</span></p>
