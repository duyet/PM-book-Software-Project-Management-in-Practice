Process Planning</span></h2>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Ravi</span><span lang=EN-GB>, like many
project managers, had studied the waterfall model of software development as
the primary software life-cycle process. He was all set to use it for an
upcoming project, his first assignment. However, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Ravi</span><span
lang=EN-GB> found that the waterfall model could not be used because the
customer wanted the software delivered in stages, something that implied that
the system had to be delivered and built in parts and not as a whole.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The situation in many other projects is not
very different. The real world rarely presents a problem in which a standard
process, or the process used in a previous project, is the best choice. To be
the most suitable, an existing process must be tailored to the new problem.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>This chapter describes the Infosys
development process and process tailoring. A development process, even after
tailoring, generally cannot handle change requests. To accommodate change
requests without losing control of the project, you must supplement the
development process with a requirement change management process. This chapter
also describes the requirement change management process used at Infosys.</span></p>
