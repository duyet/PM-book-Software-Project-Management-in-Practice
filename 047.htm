MEASUREMENT AND TRACKING PLAN</span></h3>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>In the ACIC project the standard metrics of
size, effort, defect, and schedule were measured. The plan was to use line
counters for size, the WAR system for effort, a defect control system called BugsBunny
for defects, and MSP for schedule.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The project manager planned to use MSP for
activity tracking and to have regular meetings to monitor the status of the
various activities. The issues were classified into onsite, customer, business
manager, and support services and tracked separately. Customer
feedback—complaints as well as compliments—was logged.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Status reports were sent weekly to the
business manager as well as the customer. The deviation limits for the first
five milestones were set to 10% for effort and schedule and 20% for defects. For
the rest of the milestones, the limits were set to 5% for effort and schedule
and 20% for defects. Milestone reports were also sent to the business manager
and the customer.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The final outcome of tracking and measurement
planning is included in the project management plan of the ACIC project, given
