Managing Software Projects</span></h2>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Worldwide, some half a million project
managers execute about a million software projects each year, producing
software worth $600 billion. </span>Many of these projects fail to fulfill
customers' quality expectations or fail to deliver the software within budget
and on schedule. One analysis suggests that about one-third of projects have
cost and schedule overruns of more than 125%.<a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch01lev1sec6#ch01entry01"><sup><span
style='color:#003399'>1</span></sup></a></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Why do so many software projects fail? Although
there are many reasons, one of the most important is improper management of the
project. For example, the major reasons for runaways (projects that are out of
control) are unclear objectives, bad planning, new technology, a lack of a
project management methodology, and insufficient staff.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch01lev1sec6#ch01entry02"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>2</span></sup></a><span lang=EN-GB> At least
three of these five reasons clearly relate to project management. The other
two—insufficient staff and new technology—can be considered as risks whose
management is also a part of project management.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Clearly, by using effective project
management techniques a project manager can improve the chances of success. But
what are these effective techniques?</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Let's consider an analogy. Suppose you want
to develop a muscular, toned body. To reach your goal, you start looking at
exercise routines described in magazines. One article describes how to develop
arm strength, giving a set of 10 exercises to be done—not too many by any
standard. But then another article, this one on developing thigh strength, also
gives 10 exercises, and the evangelist for flat stomachs also feels that doing
10 exercises is not too much. If you want to develop your body overall by
following each of these isolated exercise programs, you would find that you
have a set of 50 to 100 exercises to do—a clear impossibility for most people,
let alone a busy project manager. To achieve your objective, you need a
comprehensive training program that is practical and effective.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Similarly, you'll find an abundance of
suggestions for performing the various aspects of project management, including
effort estimation, risk management, project monitoring, configuration
management, and so on. Although each proposed technique solves the problem it
is designed to solve, it is not clear how to combine these techniques into a
practical and workable process. For effective project management, the need of
the hour is a practical, manageable &quot;exercise routine&quot; that will
deliver the result. In other words, what is needed is a balanced process that
covers the management of the entire project from inception to completion. Unfortunately,
there is a paucity of published approaches illustrating how to integrate
techniques in this way.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>This book fills this gap by describing the
set of processes used in a world-class organization to effectively and
efficiently manage software projects. The company is Infosys, a software
development company that has an enviable track record of project execution; in
2000 alone, Infosys project managers used the processes described here to
successfully execute about 500 projects for customers. This book discusses all
aspects of Infosys project management—planning, execution, and closure. You'll
learn how Infosys project managers estimate, plan for managing risks, collect
metrics data, set quality goals, use measurements for monitoring a project, and
so on. An interesting aspect of these processes, one that will appeal to busy
project managers, is that they are neither complex nor cumbersome, and they use
simple metrics.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Infosys has been assessed at level 5 (the
highest level) of the Capability Maturity Model (CMM). By extracting project
management processes from the set of processes at Infosys, this book also
illustrates how projects are managed in a high-maturity organization. Through
this illustration, I hope to bring the benefits of the CMM to project managers
who have not studied it because of lack of time, because they regard it as
being for &quot;process folks&quot; or because they have found it difficult to
relate the CMM to project management practices.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>This chapter introduces the two topics that
form the background for the book: the CMM and Infosys. Because the focus of the
book is project management and not the CMM, I restrict the discussion to the
project management aspects of the CMM. This chapter also provides an overview
of the project management process and the main case study; details of these are
discussed in the remainder of the book. First, then, let's briefly discuss the
role of processes in project management.</span></p>
