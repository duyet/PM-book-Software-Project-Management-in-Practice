<h3><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Arial'>7.5 SUMMARY</span></h3>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>During project planning, you must decide how
you plan to monitor the progress of the project. Progress monitoring is
essential to ensure that the project is progressing toward the goals and to
allow you to take corrective actions if the situation warrants. Project
monitoring usually requires measurements.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Following are some of the lessons from the
measurement and tracking planning at Infosys:</span></p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Plan to measure size, schedule, effort, and
defects. These suffice for most software projects.</span></p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Classify effort in a few categories, and collect
effort data using an automated system with activity codes for each category. To
avoid inaccuracies due to poor memory recall, log effort data frequently.</span></p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Log defects and track them to closure. For a
defect, also record its type, detection stage, injection stage, and severity to
support analyses such as defect removal efficiency, delivered quality, and
defect injection rate.</span></p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>For performance analysis at milestones,
establish acceptable limits for performance variation from planned for effort,
schedule, and defects. During project execution, if the performance goes beyond
these limits, management intervention may be warranted.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Although project tracking and measurement are
required by the Software Project Tracking and Oversight KPA at level 2, by the
Integrated Project Management KPA at level 3, and both the KPAs at level 4, the
CMM does not explicitly state the need for planning for these measurements. Given
that there is a general underlying principle in the CMM that major activities
to be performed must be planned, planning for measurement is implied by these KPAs.</span></p>
