<h3><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Arial'>1.1 PROCESSES
AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT</span></h3>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>A software project has two main activity
dimensions: engineering and project management. The engineering dimension deals
with building the system and focuses on issues such as how to design, test,
code, and so on. The project management dimension deals with properly planning
and controlling the engineering activities to meet project goals for cost,
schedule, and quality.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>If a project is small (say, a team of one or
two working for a few weeks), it can be executed somewhat informally. The
project plan may be an e-mail specifying the delivery date and perhaps a few
intermediate milestones. Requirements might be communicated in a note or even
verbally, and intermediate work products, such as design documents, might be
scribbles on personal note pads.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>These informal techniques, however, do not
scale up for larger projects in which many people may work for many months—the
situation for most commercial software projects. In such projects, each
engineering task must be done carefully by following well-tried methodologies,
and the work products must be properly documented so that others can review
them. The tasks in the project must be carefully planned and allocated to
project personnel and then tracked as the project executes. In other words, to
successfully execute larger projects, formality and rigor along these two
dimensions must increase.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Formality requires that well-defined
processes be used for performing the various tasks so that the outcome becomes
more dependent on the capability of the processes. Formality is further
enhanced if quantitative approaches are employed in the processes through the
use of suitable metrics.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>What is a process? Technically, a <span
class=docemphasis1>process</span> for a task comprises a sequence of steps that
should be followed to execute the task. For an organization, however, the
processes it recommends for use by its engineers and project managers are much
more than a sequence of steps; they encapsulate what the engineers and project
managers have learned about successfully executing projects. Through the
processes, the benefits of experience are conferred to everyone, including
newcomers in the organization. These processes help managers and engineers
emulate past successes and avoid the pitfalls that lead to failures.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>For a project, the engineering processes
generally specify how to perform engineering activities such as requirement
specification, design, testing, and so on. The project management processes, on
the other hand, specify how to set milestones, organize personnel, manage
risks, monitor progress, and so on. This book focuses on the project management
process.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>When you consider project management
processes, you must ask the question whether project managers will use them. I
have often heard process designers complain that project managers don't follow
the process and that they resist changes. My experience with project managers
at Infosys and other organizations is that they actually want to use processes
but only if they're reasonable and will help the project managers execute their
projects better. Project managers do, however, resent processes that seem to be
unnecessarily bureaucratic and add little value to their work. The trick, then,
is to have <span class=docemphasis1>lightweight</span> processes—those that
help project managers plan and control their projects better and that give them
the flexibility to handle various situations.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>In response to the question &quot;Why should
project managers follow processes?&quot; S.D. Shibulal—founder, director, and
the current head of customer delivery at Infosys—sums it up nicely in a few key
points:</span></p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Processes represent collective knowledge. Using
them increases your chances of success.</span></p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>A process may have some extra steps, but you
will not always know beforehand which ones are not needed, and hence you will
increase your risks by taking shortcuts.</span></p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Without processes, you cannot predict much about
the outcome of your project.</span></p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>You and the organization cannot learn
effectively without having defined processes. And learning and improvement are
imperative in today's knowledge-based world.</span></p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Processes lower your anxiety level. The
checklists inevitably cover 80 percent of what needs to be done. Hence, your
task reduces to working out the remaining 20 percent.</span></p>
