<h3><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Arial'>4.1 ESTIMATION
AND SCHEDULING CONCEPTS</span></h3>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Before we discuss the approach taken at
Infosys, this section describes some concepts relating to estimation and
scheduling. Effort estimation usually takes place in the early stages of a
project, when the software to be built is being understood. It may be redone
later when more information becomes available.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Highly precise estimates are generally not
needed. Reasonable estimates in a software project tend to become a
self-fulfilling prophecy—people work to meet the schedules (which are derived
from effort estimates). Indeed, in software projects, one cannot even precisely
answer the question, &quot;Is this estimate accurate?&quot; because the only
way to ascertain the accuracy of an estimate is to compare it with the actual
effort expended. Because of the general principle of human psychology reflected
in the maxim &quot;work expands to fill the available time,&quot; one cannot
say that just because the actual effort expended matches the estimated effort,
the estimates are &quot;accurate.&quot; Hence, the goal for a project manager
is to obtain <span class=docemphasis1>reasonable</span> estimates so that the
goals are met and the project personnel are not burned out. The range of
reasonableness is not very wide, and it depends on human factors, but it is
probably wide enough to give sufficient leeway for estimation.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Effort estimation can rely on a hunch or on
previous experience, but a more scientific and desirable approach is to use an
estimation model.</span></p>

<h4><a name=ch04lev2sec1></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>4.1.1 Effort Estimation Models</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>A software <span class=docemphasis1>estimation
model</span> defines the project characteristics whose values (or their
estimates) it needs and the ways these values are used to compute the effort. An
estimation model does not—and cannot—work in a vacuum; it needs inputs to
produce the effort estimate as output. At the start of a project, when the
details of the software itself are not known, the hope is that the estimation
model will require values of characteristics that can be measured at that
stage.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The size of the software is the predominant
factor in determining how much effort is needed to build it. But the ultimate
size is not known when the project is being conceived, and the software does
not exist. Hence, if size is to be used for the effort estimation model, it
must be estimated for the initial estimation.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>A common approach is to use a simple equation
to obtain an estimate of the overall effort from the size estimate. This
equation can be determined through regression analysis of past data on effort
and size.</span><a

the overall effort for the project is known, the effort for various phases or
activities can be determined as a percentage of the total effort.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Many models have been proposed that use this <span
class=docemphasis1>top-down approach</span> to estimation,</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch04lev1sec5#ch04entry01"><sup><span

lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>3</span></sup></a><span lang=EN-GB> with the
COCOMO model being the most famous.</span><a

lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>4</span></sup></a><span lang=EN-GB> Models
using function points (instead of LOC) as size units have also been built.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch04lev1sec5#ch04entry05"><sup><span

lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>6</span></sup></a><span lang=EN-GB> In these
models, you can accommodate other factors that affect the effort by refining
the estimates based on these factors. This is the approach taken in the COCOMO
model.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch04lev1sec5#ch04entry01"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>1</span></sup></a><span lang=EN-GB> Another
approach is to adjust the size of the system based on these parameters, as is
done in function points.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch04lev1sec5#ch04entry07"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>7</span></sup></a></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>In the <span class=docemphasis1>bottom-up
approach,</span> on the other hand, you obtain the estimates first for parts of
the project and then for the overall estimate.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch04lev1sec5#ch04entry01"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>1</span></sup></a><span lang=EN-GB> That is,
the overall estimate of the project is derived from the estimates of its parts.
One bottom-up method calls for using some type of <span class=docemphasis1>activity-based</span>
estimation. In this strategy, the major activities are first enumerated, and
then the effort for each activity is estimated. From these estimates, the
effort for the overall project is obtained.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The bottom-up approach lends itself to direct
estimation of effort; once the project is partitioned into smaller tasks, it is
possible to directly estimate the effort required for them. Although size does
play a role in determining the effort for many activities in a project, a key
advantage of this approach is that it does not require explicit size estimates
for the software. Instead, it requires a list of project tasks, which might be
easier to prepare in some situations. A risk of bottom-up methods is that you
may omit some important activities in the list of tasks. When effort is
directly estimated for tasks, it may prove difficult to directly estimate the
effort required for some overhead tasks, such as project management, that span
the project and are not as clearly defined as coding or testing.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Both the top-down and the bottom-up
approaches require information about the project: size (for top-down
approaches) and a list of tasks (for bottom-up approaches). In many ways, these
approaches are complementary.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch04lev1sec5#ch04entry01"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>1</span></sup></a><span lang=EN-GB> Both types
of estimates are more accurate if more information about the project is
available or as the project proceeds. For example, estimating the size is much
more difficult when very high level requirements are given but becomes
considerably easier when design is finished, and even easier and more accurate
when code is developed. Thus, the accuracy of estimates depends on the point at
which effort is estimated, with accuracy increasing as more information about
the project becomes available.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch04lev1sec5#ch04entry04"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>4</span></sup></a></p>

<h4><a name=ch04lev2sec2></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>4.1.2 Estimating Schedule</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Once the effort is known or fixed, various
schedules (or project <span class=docemphasis1>duration</span>) are possible,
depending on the number of <span class=docemphasis1>resources</span> (people)
put on the project. For example, for a project whose effort estimate is 56
person-months, a total schedule of 8 months is possible with 7 people. A
schedule of 7 months with 8 people is also possible, as is a schedule of
approximately 9 months with 6 people.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>As is well known, however, manpower and
months are not fully interchangeable in a software project.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch04lev1sec5#ch04entry08"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>8</span></sup></a><span lang=EN-GB> For
instance, in the example here, a schedule of 1 month with 56 people is not possible
even though the effort &quot;matches&quot; the requirement. Similarly, no one
would execute the project in 28 months with 2 people. In other words, once the
effort is fixed, you can gain some flexibility in setting the schedule by
appropriately staffing the project. But this flexibility is not unlimited, a
fact corroborated by data that shows that no simple equation between effort and
schedule fits the empirical data.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch04lev1sec5#ch04entry09"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>9</span></sup></a></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>&quot;Stretching&quot; the schedule is easy;
you simply apply fewer people (although the project may not be very valuable if
completed over a long duration). Compressing the schedule, however, is not
easy. A clear example is given earlier: You cannot compress the schedule of a
56 person-month project to 1 month regardless of the resources you apply. And,
generally speaking, compressing the schedule beyond what is &quot;normal&quot;
increases the effort; by having more resources than optimally needed, you might
end up wasting them, doing more rework, and so on.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Some approaches discuss the effect of
schedule compression on total effort. However, to assess that effect you must
first define the normal schedule for a project.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>One method to determine the <span
class=docemphasis1>normal</span> (or <span class=docemphasis1>nominal</span>)
schedule is to use a suitable function to determine it from the effort. In
turn, one method for determining the function is to study the patterns in data
from completed projects. For example, you can obtain a scatter plot of effort
and schedule for completed projects and then fit a regression curve through
this scatter plot. This curve is generally nonlinear because the schedule does
not grow linearly with effort. You can then use the equation for the curve to
determine the schedule for a project whose effort has been estimated. Many
models follow this approach, and Boehm's book summarizes the various models.</span><a
