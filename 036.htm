<h2><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:16.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Chapter 6. Risk
Management</span></h2>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>A software project is a complex undertaking. Unforeseen
events may have an adverse impact on a project's cost, schedule, or quality. <span
class=docemphasis1>Risk management</span> is an attempt to minimize the chances
of failure caused by unplanned events. The aim of risk management is not to
avoid getting into projects that have risks but rather to minimize the impact
of risks in the projects that are undertaken. In words of N.R. Narayana Murthy,
CEO of Infosys, &quot;Anything worth doing has risks. The challenge for a
leader is not to avoid them but effectively manage them through de-risking
strategies.&quot; Improper risk management, the result mainly of the common
disease of optimism, is the source of many project failures.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Vasu was designated as the project manager of
a large project undertaken by a prestigious multinational corporation. The
project was to build parts of an integrated system for worldwide human resource
management. For the final system, the software Vasu's team was to develop had
to be integrated with a system that was being developed by another vendor. For
use in the project, the customer provided proprietary tools whose new version
was to be released shortly. Vasu's team of 35 people had a little more than a year
to deliver the software. Although the project employed a good team and the
project manager made reasonable estimates, the system was commissioned six
months late, with Infosys footing the bill for the 50% effort escalation in the
project.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Why did this project fail? There are two
clear reasons. First, the software being developed by the other vendor was not
delivered on time, and the interfaces provided to Vasu's team kept changing. Second,
a new version of the customer's tools was released during development,
requiring the software to be ported to this new version.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Both of these events are clear instances of
risks that were not managed properly. These risks were evident at the start,
although, as with any risk, it was not certain that they would materialize. When
the project started, the project manager, his business manager, and the
customer hoped that the other vendor would deliver its software on time and
that the new version of the tools would not affect the project.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>In hindsight, Vasu thinks that if a steering
team—comprising the project managers of the two projects and a customer
representative—had been set up to ensure proper coordination between the two
projects and their deliveries, delays could have been minimized. For the second
risk, he thinks that the software should have been developed first with the
earlier version of the tools. Then it should have been migrated to the new
versions later through a separate project. The first solution would have
required minimal extra effort, and the cost implications are minor. The second
one has clear cost implications for the customer. Perhaps to avoid displeasing
the customer, this risk was not highlighted and its mitigation not planned.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>This chapter discusses the general concept of
risks and risk management before turning to Infosys's approach for risk
assessment and risk control—the two major steps in risk management.</span></p>
