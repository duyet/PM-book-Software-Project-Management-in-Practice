<h3><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Arial'>3.1 THE INFOSYS
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS</span></h3>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>During project planning, a project manager
must decide what process should be used for engineering the software. This is a
crucial issue because much of the engineering activity will be governed by this
decision. It is like going on a long driving trip—the planned route determines
the course you will drive.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Several process models for software
development exist. The most common ones include the waterfall model (a
description of this model and its limitations can be found in Boehm's <span
class=docemphasis1>Software Engineering Economics</span> </span><a

spiral.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch03lev1sec5#ch03entry04"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>4</span></sup></a><span lang=EN-GB> The most
widely used model is the waterfall model, which organizes the phases in a
linear sequence, although most implementations adapt this model to minimize its
shortcomings.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>At a macro level, a standard process can give
the optimum organization of phases for a class of projects and makes a good
starting point for process definition. However, a standard process cannot be
suitable for all situations; the best process may be a variation on a standard
process. Hence, to decide which process to use, the project manager must select
the base process and also decide how it must be tailored to obtain a process
that will suit the project. The rest of this section discusses the standard
development process used at Infosys and explains how it is tailored by project
managers.</span></p>

<h4><a name=ch03lev2sec1></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>3.1.1 The Standard Process</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The standard development process used at
Infosys resembles the waterfall model, although the traditional phases have
been broken into smaller phases, or stages, to allow parallel execution of some
phases. For example, planning for system testing is defined as a separate phase
from system testing itself, a practice that allows teams to conduct the system
test planning phase in parallel with coding, even though system testing takes
place only after coding is finished.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The phases in the process include
requirements analysis, high-level design, detailed design, build, unit testing,
integration planning, integration, system test planning, system testing,
documentation, acceptance and installation, and warranty support. </span><a

lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>Figure 3.1</span></a><span lang=EN-GB> depicts
the phases and the dependencies between them. Details of the stages are omitted
here, although they are described in my earlier book.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch03lev1sec5#ch03entry05"><sup><span

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The formal description of this process
specifies the entry and exit criteria, inputs and outputs, participants,
activities, and other information for each phase (stage). The process
descriptions are generally brief, specifying the list of activities to be
undertaken in that phase.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>This overall process remains the same even
for a project using an object-oriented approach, although some of the phases
are done differently in such a project. The difference lies mostly in the
analysis and design phases, although the guidelines and standards for some of
the later phases are also different.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>This basic process is also used by projects
that do iterative development or prototyping or perform only some stages of the
life cycle. In these situations this standard process is adjusted to suit the
project. These adjustments are done through process tailoring, which is
discussed next.</span></p>

<h4><a name=ch03lev2sec2></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>3.1.2 Process Tailoring</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>No defined process—whether an organization's
standard process or the process used in a previous project—will apply to all
situations and all projects. A defined process must be tailored to suit the
needs of the current project.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span class=docemphasis1><span lang=EN-GB>Tailoring</span></span><span
lang=EN-GB> is the process of adjusting a previously defined process of an
organization to obtain a process that is suitable for the particular business
or technical needs of a project.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch03lev1sec5#ch03entry05"><sup><span

view tailoring as adding, deleting, or modifying the activities of a process so
that the resulting process is better suited to achieving the project's goals.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Uncontrolled tailoring effectively implies
creating a process from scratch. To allow effective reuse of previously defined
processes, tailoring guidelines are provided. These guidelines define the
conditions and the types of changes that should be made to a standard process. In
essence, they define a set of <span class=docemphasis1>permitted</span> <span
class=docemphasis1>deviations</span> to the standard process in the hope that
the optimal process can be defined for a project. </span><a

guidelines.</p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>To illustrate the need for tailoring, let's
take an activity in the build phase of the development process—<span
class=docemphasis1>Do code review.</span> Code review adds a great deal of
value in many cases, but sometimes its added value is not commensurate with the
effort required. Also, the review could be done by either a group (following
the group review procedure) or by one person. The standard development process
does not specify how code review should be performed. Tailoring guidelines can
help a project manager by advising that the activity <span class=docemphasis1>Do
code review</span> be performed only for certain types of programs (such as
complex programs or external interfaces) and by suggesting the optimal form of
the review (group review or one-person review).</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The Infosys tailoring approach is similar to
the table-based approach proposed by Ginsberg and Quinn,</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch03lev1sec5#ch03entry07"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>7</span></sup></a><span lang=EN-GB> in which
the project manager specifies the process element, the tailorable attribute,
the options for each attribute, and the reasons for selecting a particular
option. A project manager performs tailoring at two levels: summary and
detailed.</span></p>

<h5><a name=ch03lev3sec1></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.5pt;
font-family:Arial'>Summary-Level Tailoring</span></h5>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>In <span class=docemphasis1>summary-level
tailoring</span>, depending on the project characteristics, the project manager
applies overall guidelines for tailoring the standard process. That is, it
provides some general rules regarding certain types of detailed activities. To
perform this step, the project manager first identifies certain characteristics
of the project. For development projects, the following characteristics are
used for tailoring:</span></p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Experience and skill level of the team and the
project manager</span></p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Peak team size</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Clarity of the requirements</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Project duration</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Application criticality</p>

<p class=doctext>The experience level of the team is considered high if a
majority of team members have more than two years of experience with the
technology being deployed in the project; otherwise, it is considered low.
Application criticality is considered high if the effect of the application on
a customer's business or Infosys's business is significant; otherwise, it is
low. Duration of the project is considered particularly short if the project
must be delivered in less than three months.</p>

<p class=doctext>Summary tailoring guidelines are provided for different values
of these characteristics. The summary guidelines are generally review-related,
effort-related, schedule-related, resources-related, or formality-related.
Review-related guidelines typically specify when reviews should be done and
what type of review should take place. Similarly, the effort-related guidelines
suggest steps to be taken for the project that may affect the effort. These
general guidelines set the context for detailed process tailoring and defining
a suitable process for the project.</p>

<h5><a name=ch03lev3sec2></a><span style='font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Detailed
Tailoring</span></h5>

<p class=doctext><span class=docemphasis1>Detailed tailoring</span> covers execution
of activities, their review, and documentation needs. Tailoring guidelines may
specify an activity as optional, in which case the project manager can decide
whether or not to execute the activity. Similarly, preparation of some
documents may be optional, in which case the project manager decides whether or
not the project needs the document. For review, the general alternatives are <span
class=docemphasis1>Do group review, Do one-person review,</span> or <span
class=docemphasis1>Do not review</span>. In addition, a project manager may add
some new activities or may repeat some activities.</p>

<p class=doctext>When detailed tailoring is finished, the sequence of
activities to be performed in the process for the project is defined. These
definitions are then used to plan and schedule activities and form the basis of
project execution. The tailoring performed is highlighted in the project plan,
so the process definition and tailoring also are reviewed when the plan is
reviewed.</p>

<h4><a name=ch03lev2sec3></a><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:Arial'>3.1.3
Example: Tailoring for Short-Duration Projects</span></h4>

<p class=doctext>We illustrate the concept of tailoring by showing the summary-level
tailoring for short-duration projects. Infosys observed that the duration of
software projects has decreased over the years, and there is increased demand
for projects of very short duration. Clearly, such projects require processes
to be tailored to allow maximum parallelism and very tight project monitoring
and control. The process tailoring depends on the clarity of the requirements,
the experience level of the team or the project leader, the size of the team,
and so on. <a
href="http:// /JVXSL.asp?x=1&amp;mode=section&amp;sortKey=insertDate&amp;sortOrder=desc&amp;view=book&amp;xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch03lev1sec1&amp;open=true&amp;title=New%20This%20Week&amp;catid=&amp;s=1&amp;b=1&amp;f=1&amp;t=1&amp;c=1&amp;u=1#ch03table01#ch03table01"><span
style='color:#003399'>Table 3.1</span></a> shows tailoring guidelines prepared
by project managers of such projects for one combination of values.</p>

<p class=doctext>Because the shortness of the schedule is the main
characteristic, schedule-related guidelines suggest the use of a technique
called timeboxing and mini-milestones. In <span class=docemphasis1>timeboxing</span>,
several-week duration cycles are planned, and a working system is delivered
after each cycle. To keep tight control on the timeboxes, <span
class=docemphasis1>mini-milestones—</span>milestones within the cycle—are also
set. At mini-milestones, a limited milestone analysis (see <a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch11#ch11"><span
style='color:#003399'>Chapter 11</span></a>) is done. Most of the other
guidelines are self-explanatory.</p>

<p class=doctext>A project manager who must execute a short-duration project
can use these guidelines to tailor the development process. For example, the
project manager may plan to use iterative delivery with short iterations,
perform limited milestone analysis but more frequently, define a change
management process that defers most change requests to the next iteration, and
so on. In addition, while performing detailed tailoring to define the project's
process, the project manager may reduce the documentation for each cycle by,
for example, reducing the scope of the templates used for reporting status.</p>

a project whose duration is less than three months, has a peak team size of
more than five, is working with new technology, and has an experienced project
leader. During detailed tailoring, the project manager chooses options based on
the summary guidelines and suitability to the project. If, however, the
tailoring guidelines are not sufficient to allow you to select the right
process for the project, you may have to modify the process beyond what was
allowed by the tailoring guidelines. Such deviations represent potential risks
and hence are highlighted in the project management plan, which is reviewed and
approved.</span></p>
