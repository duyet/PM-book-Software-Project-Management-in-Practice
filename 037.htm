<h3><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Arial'>6.1 CONCEPTS OF
RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT</span></h3>

<p class=doctext><span class=docemphasis1><span lang=EN-GB>Risks</span></span><span
lang=EN-GB> are those events or conditions that <span class=docemphasis1>may</span>
occur, and whose occurrence, if it does take place, has a harmful or negative
effect on a project. Risks should not be confused with events and conditions
that require management intervention or action. A project manager must deal
with and plan for those situations that are likely to occur but whose exact
nature is not known beforehand; such situations, however, are not risks. For
example, it is almost certain that defects will be found during software
testing, so a reasonable project must plan to fix these defects when they are
found. Similarly, it is almost certain that some change requests will come, so
project management must be prepared for changes and plan accordingly to handle
such normal events.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>A risk, on the other hand, is a probabilistic
event—it may or may not occur. For this reason, we frequently have an
optimistic tendency to simply not see risks or to wish that they will not
occur. Social and organizational factors also may stigmatize risks and
discourage clear identification of them.</span><a

lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>1</span></sup></a><span lang=EN-GB> This kind
of attitude gets the project in trouble if the risk events materialize,
something that is likely to happen in a large project. Not surprisingly, then,
risk management is considered first among the best practices for managing large
software projects.</span><a

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Risk management aims to identify the risks
and then take actions to minimize their effect on the project. Risk management
is a relatively new area in software management. It first came to the forefront
with Boehm's tutorial on risk management.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch06lev1sec6#ch06entry03"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>3</span></sup></a><span lang=EN-GB> Since
then, several books have targeted risk management for software.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch06lev1sec6#ch06entry04"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>4</span></sup></a><sup><span lang=EN-GB>,</span></sup><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch06lev1sec6#ch06entry05"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>5</span></sup></a></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Before we discuss risks in the software
context, let's examine the concept a bit more with the aid of an example. Consider
a computer show for which an important goal is to provide uninterrupted
computer services. For this goal, one clear risk is electric power failure. The
power may or may not fail. If it does fail, even for a second, the computer
services will be affected substantially (the machines will have to reboot, data
will be lost, and so on). If this case is unacceptable (that is, if the cost of
the power failure is high), a universal power supply (UPS) can be deployed to
minimize its consequences. If it is suspected that the power may go out for a
long period, a backup generator may be set up to minimize the problem. With
these risk management systems in place, if the power does go out, even for a
long period, the show-related goal will not be compromised.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The first thing to note from this example is
that risk management entails <span class=docemphasis1>additional cost.</span> Here,
the cost for the UPS and the generator is extra because these components would
not be needed if the risk of power failure did not exist (for example, if the
electric supply company guaranteed continuous power). Hence, risk management
can be considered cost-effective only if the cost of risk management is
considerably less than the loss incurred if the risk materializes.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch06lev1sec6#ch06entry05"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>5</span></sup></a><span lang=EN-GB> (Actually,
the cost of risk management should be less than the <span class=docemphasis1>expected
value</span> of the loss, a concept defined shortly.) For example, if the loss
due to power failure is low, the cost of a UPS is not justified—a situation
that prevails, for example, in homes.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Second, it is not easy to measure the value
of risk management, particularly in hindsight. If the power fails for one-half
hour during the show, the value provided by the UPS and generator might be
calculated as the &quot;savings&quot; achieved by having the computers running
while the power was out. Suppose, however, that the power supply does not fail
even for a second and therefore the UPS and generator are not used. Does this
mean that the expenditure on these components was a waste? No, because the
power <span class=docemphasis1>could have</span> failed. If the risk does not
materialize, the value of using risk management cannot be directly measured in
terms of value or output produced. Because risk events likely occur infrequently,
the chances are high that risk management systems will not be used during the
project. It is this probabilistic nature of risks and the inability to always
realize the direct value of risk mitigation efforts that make it difficult to
manage risk.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>From this example, it is clear that the first
step in risk management is to identify the possible risks (power failure in
this example) and to assess the consequences (loss of face or clients). Once
you have done risk assessment, you can develop a risk management plan (for
example, having a UPS). Overall, then, risk management has two key components:
risk assessment and risk control. Each component involves different tasks, as
shown in </span><a

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The purpose of the risk assessment task is to
identify the risks, analyze them, and then prioritize them. In prioritizing
risks, you identify the risks that should be managed. In other words,
prioritization determines where the extra effort of risk management should be
spent to get the maximum benefit. For this effort, two factors are important.
First is the chance of a risk occurring; a more likely risk is a natural
candidate for risk management. Second is the effect of the risk; a risk whose
impact is very high is also a likely candidate.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>One way to prioritize risks, therefore, is to
estimate the probability of its occurrence and its consequences when it does
occur. The product of these values, the <span class=docemphasis1>expected value</span>
of the loss for the risk, can be used for prioritization. This expected value
is called <span class=docemphasis1>risk exposure</span>. If Prob(R) is the
probability of a risk R occurring and if Loss(R) is the total loss incurred if
the risk materializes, then risk exposure, RE, for the risk is given by the
following equation</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch06lev1sec6#ch06entry03"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>3</span></sup></a><span lang=EN-GB>:</span></p>

<p class=doclist><span lang=EN-GB>RE (R) = Prob(R) x Loss(R)</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Once the risks have been prioritized, you
must decide what to do about them. Which ones will be managed is a management
decision. Perhaps only the top few need to be handled in a project.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>One approach is to take preventive or
avoidance actions so that the perceived risk ceases to be a risk. For example,
if new hardware is a risk, it could be avoided by implementing the project with
proven hardware. Such actions, however, are not always feasible—for example, if
working with new hardware is a requirement from the customer. In such
situations, the risks to the project must be handled properly.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>For each risk that will be handled, you must
devise and then execute risk management plans. Because risk perception changes
with time, you must also monitor both the risk and the execution of the plans
to minimize its consequences. In a project, risk perceptions may evolve
naturally, or the risk management plans put into action may reduce the risk. In
either case, it is important to continually gauge the status of risks and their
management plans.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Risk management can be integrated in the
development process itself, as is done in the spiral model of software
development.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch06lev1sec6#ch06entry06"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>6</span></sup></a><span lang=EN-GB> If you
treat risk management as a separate process, you must understand its
relationship with project execution, depicted in </span><a
href="http:// /JVXSL.asp?x=1&amp;mode=section&amp;sortKey=insertDate&amp;sortOrder=desc&amp;view=book&amp;xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch06lev1sec1&amp;open=true&amp;title=New%20This%20Week&amp;catid=&amp;s=1&amp;b=1&amp;f=1&amp;t=1&amp;c=1&amp;u=1#ch06fig02#ch06fig02"><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>Figure 6.2</span></a><span lang=EN-GB>. As
shown in the figure, risk assessment and monitoring take information from project
execution, along with other factors, to identify risks to be managed. The risk
management activities, on the other hand, affect the project's process for
minimizing the consequences of the risk.</span></p>
