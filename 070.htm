<h2><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:16.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Chapter 11.
Project Monitoring and Control</span></h2>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>A project plan, no matter how carefully
prepared, is still only a piece of paper. During project execution, Dr. Project
Manager must carefully monitor the health of his project-patient and give the
right doses of corrective-action medicines when necessary. If the right doses
are given at the right times, the patient survives. But failing to read the
symptoms properly and failing to give the bitter pills on time can lead to
further complications and possibly the death of the patient. The following two
mini-cases illustrate this point.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Case A: Shiva was the project manager in
charge of developing a secure transaction system for a large mutual fund company.
His team, consisting of many dedicated but junior people, had little experience
in computer security. The unit testing for the first few modules found a large
number of defects—much more than expected. Upon analysis, Shiva concluded that
because of the difficulty of the programs and the inexperience of the
programmers, the code being produced had more defects. Consequently, he felt,
more defects would reach the integration and system testing stage, and unless
something was done, more defects would be delivered. The corrective and
preventive action Shiva took was to create a separate test team headed by a
person who had a knack for detail and the right temperament for testing. </span>Through
discussion with the customer, he was able to expand the system testing phase by
15 days. Finally, even though there was a delay of 15 days, the delivered
system exceeded its quality goal by showing fewer than expected defects during
acceptance testing.</p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Case B: After the detailed design phase, the
milestone analysis in Bala's project showed that even though there was no
schedule slippage, there was an effort overrun of 40%. Because the schedule had
not slipped, no action was taken. At the next milestone a month later, however,
the project showed a delay of one week, which Bala explained as the result of
special circumstances. Eventually, the development was finished one month late.
To top it off, the number of defects found in acceptance testing was many times
Bala's quality goal. In the end, his project failed on all three dimensions:
effort, schedule, and quality. Later analysis showed that he had misunderstood
the scope of the system and consequently had grossly underestimated the effort.
If the scope or the schedule had been renegotiated when problems first appeared
after the design milestone, the final outcome would have been entirely
different.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>These mini-cases bring out the two key
aspects of project monitoring. First, project managers must have visibility
into the true status of the project, for which the best approach is to
quantitatively measure the key parameters.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch11lev1sec7#ch11entry01"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>1</span></sup></a><sup><span lang=EN-GB>,</span></sup><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch11lev1sec7#ch11entry02"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>2</span></sup></a><span lang=EN-GB> For
project managers, the main use of software metrics is to provide this
visibility.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch11lev1sec7#ch11entry03"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>3</span></sup></a><span lang=EN-GB> Second,
the visibility by itself does not solve any problem. Project managers must
properly interpret the data, and if they find that the project is not moving
along the planned path, they must apply proper corrective actions to bring it
back on track. This collection of data to provide feedback about the current
state and any needed corrective actions forms a fundamental paradigm of project
management. </span><a

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>This chapter describes how the monitoring and
control cycle is applied at Infosys. This is the longest chapter in the book
and covers a range of monitoring activities, including status reporting,
milestone analysis, event-level control through SPC, process audits, and
analysis for defect prevention.</span></p>
