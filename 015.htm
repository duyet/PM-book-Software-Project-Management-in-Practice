<h3><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Arial'>2.4 SUMMARY</span></h3>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>A project manager can plan a project better
if past experience on projects is available. The project planning
infrastructure can help effectively capture data and lessons learned and make
them available to project managers. The main components of the planning
infrastructure at Infosys are the process database, the process capability
baseline, and the process assets. </span>These elements have the following key
characteristics:</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>A process database contains the performance data
of completed projects. It contains data on risks, effort and effort
distribution, defect and defect distribution, size, and other project
characteristics.</span></p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The process capability baseline summarizes the
process performance across projects, thereby specifying the range of results to
be expected if the processes are followed. It contains measures such as
quality, productivity, defect removal efficiency, and effort and defect
distribution.</span></p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Process assets are documents such as checklists,
templates, methodologies, and guidelines. They improve productivity by reducing
effort required to do some tasks, and they improve quality by reducing defects
or catching them early.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>If these elements are not in place in an
organization, project managers can take actions to build limited forms of some
of these components. A few project managers who get together and collect their
experience can build a limited PDB. The key issue here is to perform project
closure analysis (discussed in </span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch12#ch12"><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>Chapter 12</span></a><span lang=EN-GB>). When
you have created a limited PDB, you can also extract some aspects of a PCB. Building
a set of process assets is even easier; you simply collect the templates, checklists,
and similar materials that are used in projects. Then you review and polish
them and make them available.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>These infrastructure elements do not directly
satisfy requirements of the CMM KPAs dealing with project management. They are,
however, necessary for satisfying many of the project-management-related KPAs
at levels 3 and 4. The systems discussed in this chapter also satisfy
requirements of some other KPAs of the CMM. For example, existence of a process
database is explicitly required by the CMM at level 3, as is the management of
process assets. The process capability baseline is needed by both the KPAs at
level 4.</span></p>
