<h3><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Arial'>8.3 THE
STRUCTURE OF THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN</span></h3>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The project management plan template provided
at Infosys has four major sections. The <span class=docemphasis1>project
summary</span> section gives a high-level overview of the project. It includes
information on the start and end dates, the project leader, contacts at the
customer end, project objectives, major commitments made to the customer on
milestones and deliverables, and assumptions made. The assumptions made are
explicitly listed because they frequently serve as a source of risks. Details
of billing may also be described (so that the business manager can track them).
The objectives of the project—from the customer's perspective as well as from Infosys's
perspective—are mentioned so that it is clear to everyone why the project is
being executed.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The <span class=docemphasis1>project planning</span>
section lists the outputs of executing the various project planning procedures.
It includes the development process being used, tailoring notes, the
requirement change management process, requirement traceability plans, effort
and schedule estimates along with their basis, and the people requirement by
skill, role, monthwise, or a combination of these. It also specifies the
development environment needed, the tools employed, and any project-specific
training plans. The quality plan and the risk management plan are also given in
this section.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The <span class=docemphasis1>project tracking</span>
section defines the measurements to be taken and the systems to be used for
recording data, various project tracking activities to be undertaken, the
frequency and nature of the progress reporting, and escalation procedures.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The <span class=docemphasis1>project team</span>
section defines the project team and its structure, as well as the roles and
responsibilities of the various people.</span></p>
