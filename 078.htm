<h2><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:16.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Chapter 12.
Project Closure</span></h2>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The software has been delivered and installed
successfully. After working long hours and weekends for many months on this
project, the project manager and his team heave a sigh of relief that this not
very successful project is finished. But did the project manager learn any
lessons? Will he and the team members be able to avoid repeating the problems
they got into in this project? If the project ends now, it is likely that the
story will be repeated in another project, perhaps with minor improvements.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>For the project manager, the team, and the
organization, the project does not end until a postmortem has been done to
uncover what went wrong and why, and what worked and why. This analysis will
enable the project manager and the team members to cull out key lessons on
project execution. In addition to helping the team members in their future
projects, these lessons will also help other projects to improve their
execution.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>A project closure analysis, or postmortem
analysis, is a golden opportunity for process improvement that should not be
missed.</span><a
