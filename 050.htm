<h2><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:16.5pt;font-family:Arial'>Chapter 8. The
Project Management Plan</span></h2>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The project management plan (PMP) document is
the culmination of all planning activities undertaken by project managers. The
outputs of the various planning activities appear in this document, which
becomes the baseline document guiding the overall execution of the project. It
should not be confused with the detailed project schedule, which represents
only the schedule and assignment of activities.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Documenting the planning outputs enables the
project plan to be reviewed for deficiencies. At Infosys, project plans are
usually reviewed by a group that includes project managers, members of the
SEPG, and senior management. In many instances, a project plan review has
revealed glaring shortcomings that, if not corrected, could have spelled
trouble for the project. A thorough review of the management plan is one of the
best ways to nip potential problems in the bud—a huge value to project
managers, particularly those who are less experienced.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The document also serves an important
communication purpose. It gives senior management an overall view of the
project goals and commitments and describes how the project will be managed to
meet them. It gives the project team a comprehensive view of the project and
the roles of the individual team members.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Although we have discussed most of the
planning activities, so far we have not discussed the team and communication
issues, which are covered in this chapter. Here, we also discuss the structure
of the template used at Infosys to document the plan and examine the project
management plan of the ACIC project.</span></p>
